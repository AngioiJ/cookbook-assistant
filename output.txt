442— EQGS  EN  COCOTTE  WITH  CREAM 
This  preparation  constitutes  the  radical  type  of  this  series 
of  eggs,  and,  for  a  long  time,  was  the  only  one  in  use.  Heat 
the  cocottes  beforehand;  pour  a  tablespoonful  of  boiling  cream 
into  each,  followed  by  an  egg,  broken ;  season,  and  add  two 
little  lumps  of  butter,  the  size  of  peas.  Place  the  cocottes  in 
a  bain-marie,  and  poach  as  before.

449— MOULDED  EGGS 
These  form  a  very  ornamental  dish,  but  the  time  required 
to  prepare  them  being  comparatively  long,  poached,  soft-boiled, 
and  other  kinds  of  eggs  are  generally  preferred  in  their  stead. 
They  are  made  in  variously  shaped  moulds,  ornamented  accord- 
ing to  the  nature  of  the  preparation,  and  the  eggs  are  broken 
into  them  direct,  or  they  may  be  inserted  in  the  form  of 
scrambled  eggs,  together  with  raw  eggs  poached  in  a  hain- 
marie. 
Whatever  be  the  mode  of  preparation,  the  moulds  should 
always  be  liberally  buttered.  The  usual  time  allowed  for  the 
poaching  of  the  eggs  in  moulds  is  from  ten  to  twelve  minutes, 
but  when  withdrawn  from  the  bain-marie  it  is  well  to  let  the 
moulds  stand  awhile  with  the  view  of  promoting  a  settling  of 
their  contents,  which  action  facilitates  the  ultimate  turning  out 
of  the  latter. 
Empty  the  moulds  on  small  pieces  of  toast  or  tartlets,  and 
arrange  these  in  a  circle  round  the  dish.

season,  place  carefully  in  a  bain-marie,  and  poach,  with  cover 
on,  in  the  oven,  leaving  a  small  opening  for  the  escape  of  the 
generated  vapour.  Empty  the  moulds  on  toast  cut  to  the  same 
shape  as  the  moulds  and  fried  in  butter;  arrange  them  on  the

This  dish  is  undoubtedly  the  finest  of  all  egg-preparations, 
provided  the  eggs  be  not  over-cooked,  and  they  be  kept  soft 
and  creamy. 
Scrambled  eggs  are  mostly  served  in  silver  timbales,  but,  in 
certain  cases,  they  may  also  be  dished  in  special  little  croustades, 
in  little  receptacles  made  from  hollowed  brioches,  or  in  tartlet-

crusts.  Formerly,  it  was  customary  to  garnish  scrambled  eggs 
served  in  a  silver  timbale  with  small,  variously-shaped  pieces 
of  toast,  or  with  small  scraps  of  puff-paste,  cooked  without 
colouration,  and  shaped  like  crescents,  lozenges,  rings,  palm- 
ettes,  &c.  This  method  has  something  to  recommend  it,  and 
may  always  be  adopted.  In  old  cookery,  scrambled  eggs  were 
sanctioned  only  when  cooked  in  a  bain-marie.  This  measure 
certainly  ensured  their  being  properly  cooked,  but  it  consider- 
ably lengthened  the  procedure.  The  latter  may  therefore  be 
shortened  by  cooking  the  eggs  in  the  usual  way,  i.e.,  in  a 
utensil  in  direct  contact  with  the  fire;  but  in  this  case  the  heat 
must  be  moderate,  in  order  that,  the  process  of  cooking  being 
progressive  and  gradual,  perfect  homogeneity  of  the  particles 
of  the  eggs  (effecting  the  smoothness  of  the  preparation)  may 
result. 
460— METHOD  OF  SCRAMBLING  EQQS 
For  six  eggs,  slightly  heat  one  oz.  of  butter  in  a  thick- 
bottomed  saut6-pan.  Add  the  six  eggs,  beaten  moderately, 
together  with  a  large  pinch  of  salt  and  a  little  pepper ;  place  the 
pan  on  a  moderate  fire,  and  stir  constantly  with  a  wooden 
spoon,  taking  care  to  avoid  anything  in  the  way  of  sudden, 
fierce  heat,  which,  by  instantaneously  solidifying  the  egg- 
molecules,  would  cause  lumps  to  form  in  the  mass — a  thing 
which,  above  all,  should  be  guarded  against. 
When,  by  cooking,  the  eggs  have  acquired  the  proper  con- 
sistence, and  are  still  smooth  and  creamy,  take  the  saut6-pan 
off  the  fire,  and  finish  the  preparation  by  means  of  one  and 
one-half  oz.  of  butter  (divided  into  small  quantities)  and  three 
tablespoonfuls  of  cream.  Only  whisk  the  eggs  to  be  scrambled 
when  absolutely  necessary. 
N.B. — Having  given  the  mode  of  procedure,  which  is  un- 
alterable for  scrambled  eggs,  I  shall  now  pass  on,  in  the  follow- 
ing recipes,  to  the  various  garnishes  suited  to  this  kind  of  dish. 
The  quantities  I  give  are  those  required  for  six  scrambled  eggs.

In  the  long  series  of  egg-preparations,  fried  eggs  are  those 
which  hold  the  least  important  place,  for  the  fried  eggs  which 
are  so  commonly  served  at  breakfasts  in  England  and  America 
are  really  eggs  a  la  poele.  The  real  fried  egg  is  almost  un- 
known in  England  and  America.  As  a  rule,  the  garnish  given 
to  this  kind  of  eggs  is  served  apart,  while  the  latter  are  dished, 
either  on  a  napkin  or  on  pieces  of  toast,  with  a  little  fried  parsley

Heat  some  oil  in  an  omelet-pan  until  it  begins  to  smoke 
slightly ;  break  the  egg  on  a  plate ;  season  it,  and  let  it  slide  into 
the  pan.  Then,  with  a  wooden  spoon,  quickly  cover  up  the 
yolk  with  the  solidified  portions  of  the  white,  in  order  to  keep 
the  former  soft. 
Drain  the  egg  on  a  piece  of  stretched  linen,  and  proceed 
in  the  same  way  with  the  other  eggs  until  the  required  quantity 
has  been  treated.

485— HARVESTERS'  FRIED  EGGS 
Fry  as  many  blanched  rashers  of  breast  of  bacon  as  there 
are  eggs.  Arrange  in  a  circle  on  a  dish,  alternating  the  rasher 
with  the  eggs.  Garnish  the  centre  with  large  peas,  cooked 
with  ciseled  lettuce  and  finely-sliced  potatoes. 
486— FRIED  POACHED  EQQS 
This  kind  is  recommended,  because  it  may  be  served  with 
various  garnishes— either  vegetables  of  the  same  nature,  a 
macedoine,  vegetable  purees,  or  divers  cullises,  sauces  in  keep- 
ing with  the  eggs,  artichoke-bottoms,  mushrooms,  morels,  &c. 
(sliced  and  sauted  in  butter),  or  tomato-fondue,  &c. 
After  having  properly  drained  and  dried  the  poached  eggs, 
which  should  have  been  prepared  beforehand,  dip  them  care- 
fully in  a  Villeroy  sauce  (No.  108),  and  arrange  them,  one  by 
one,  on  a  dish.  When  the  sauce  has  set,  pass  the  point  of  a 
small  knife  round  the  eggs  to  remove  any  excess  of  sauce; 
take  them  off  the  dish  to  treat  them  with  an  anglaise  (No.  174), 
and  then  roll  them  in  very  fine,  fresh  bread-crumbs. 
Plunge  them  into  very  hot  fat  three  or  four  minutes  before 
serving ;  drain  them  on  a  piece  of  linen ;  salt  slightly,  arrange 
in  a  circle  on  a  dish,  and  set  the  selected  garnish  in  the  middle.

490— FRIED  EGGS  A  LA  VERDI 
Cut  six  hard-boiled  eggs  lengthwise.  Remove  the  yolks, 
pound  them  with  two  oz.  of  butter,  and  add  thereto  two  table- 
spoonfuls  of  thick,  cold  Bechamel,  two  tablespoonfuls  of  cooked 
herbs,  and  one  tablespoonful  of  lean  ham,  cooked  and  chopped. 
Garnish  each  half-white  of  egg  with  a  good  tablespoonful  of 
this  preparation,  and  smooth  it  with  the  blade  of  a  small  knife, 
shaping  it  in  such  wise  as  to  represent  the  other  half  of  the 
egg.  Dip  each  whole  egg,  thus  formed,  into  an  anglaise,  and 
roll  in  fine,  fresh  bread-crumbs.  Plunge  in  hot  fat  six  minutes 
before  serving,  and  dish  on  a  napkin,  with  fried  parsley  in  the 
centre.  Send,  separately,  to  the  table  a  garnish  composed  of 
asparagus-heads . 
491— FRIED  POACHED  EGGS  A  LA  VILLEROY 
Prepare  the  eggs,  poached  beforehand,  as  explained  under 
No.  486.  Fry  them  similarly,  and  dish  them  on  a  napkin,  with 
a  garnish  of  fried  parsley  in  the  centre. 
Omelets 
The  procedure  for  omelets  is  at  once  very  simple  and  very 
difficult,  for  tastes  differ  considerably  in  respect  of  their  pre- 
paration. Some  like  them  well  done,  others  insist  upon  their 
being  just  done,  while  there  are  yet  others  who  only  enjoy  them 
when  they  are  almost  liquid. 
Nevertheless,  the  following  conditions  apply  to  all — namely, 
that  there  should  be  homogeneity  of  the  egg-molecules;  that 
the  whole  mass  should  be  smooth  and  soft;  and  that  it  should 
be  borne  in  mind  that  an  omelet  is  in  reality  scrambled  eggs 
enclosed  in  a  coat  composed  of  coagulated  egg. 
I  take  as  my  standard  an  omelet  consisting  of  three  eggs, 
the  seasoning  of  which  comprises  a  small  pinch  of  table-salt  and 
a  little  pepper,  and  which  requires  one-half  oz.  of  butter  for  its 
preparation.  The  quantities  of  garnishing  ingredients  given 
below,  therefore,  are  based  upon  this  standard. 
i86  GUIDE  TO  MODERN  COOKERY 
492— THE  PREPARATION  OF  OMELETS 
Heat  the  butter  in  the  omelet-pan,  until  it  exhales  the  char- 
acteristic nutty  smell.  This  will  not  only  lend  an  exquisite 
taste  to  the  omelet,  but  the  degree  of  heat  reached  in  order  to 
produce  the  aroma  will  be  found  to  ensure  the  perfect  setting 
of  the  eggs. 
Pour  in  the  beaten  and  seasoned  eggs,  and  stir  briskly  with 
a  fork,  in  order  to  heat  the  whole  mass  evenly.  If  the  omelet 
is  to  be  garnished  inside,  this  ought  to  be  done  at  the  present 
stage,  and  then  the  omelet  should  be  speedily  rolled  up  and 
transferred  to  a  dish,  to  be  finished  in  accordance  with  the  nature 
of  its  designation. 
When  the  omelet  is  on  the  dish,  a  piece  of  butter  may  be 
quickly  drawn  across  its  surface,  to  make  it  glossy. 
493— AONES  SOREL  OMELET 
Stuff  the  omelet  with  one  tablespoonful  of  mushrooms, 
minced  and  sauted  in  butter.  Roll  it  up,  and  transfer  it  to  a 
dish. 
Then  lay  eight  small  slices  of  very  red  tongue  upon  it,  let- 
ting their  edges  overlap ;  surround  with  a  thread  of  veal  gravy. 
494— OMELET  A  LA  BRUXELLOISE 
Stuff  the  omelet  with  two  tablespoonfuls  of  braised  endives, 
ciseled  and  thickened  with  cream.  Surround  with  a  thread  of 
cream  sauce. 
495— OMELET  WITH  CfePES 
Finely  mince  two  oz.  of  cepes ;  toss  them  in  butter  in  an 
omelet-pan  until  they  have  acquired  a  brown  colour;  add  thereto 
a  pinch  of  chopped  shallots,  and  toss  them  again  for  a  moment. 
Pour  the  eggs  into  the  omelet-pan;  make  the  omelet;  dish 
up,  and  surround  with  a  thread  of  half-glaze. 
496— OMELET  WITH  MUSHROOMS 
Mince  two  oz.  of  raw  mushrooms;  toss  them  in  butter  in  an 
omelet-pan ;  add  the  eggs  thereto,  and  make  the  omelet.  Trans- 
fer it  to  a  dish,  lay  three  little  cooked  and  grooved  mushrooms 
upon  it,  and  surround  with  a  thread  of  half-glaze. 
EGGS  187 
497— OMELET  A  LA  CHOISY 
Stuff  the  omelet  with  two  tablespoonfuls  of  braised  lettuce ; 
the  latter  should  have  been  ciseled  and  cohered  by  means  of 
cream  sauce. 
Roll  and  dish  the  omelet,  and  surround  it  with  a  thread  of 
cream  sauce. 
498— OMELET  A  LA  CLAMART 
Stuff  the  omelet  with  two  tablespoonfuls  of  fresh  peas,  bound 
by  means  of  butter  and  combined  with  a  portion  of  the  lettuce 
used  in  cooking  them,  finely  ciseled.  Roll  and  dish  the  omelet, 
make  an  opening  lengthwise  in  the  centre,  and  fill  the  inter- 
space with  a  tablespoonful  of  fresh  peas. 
499— OMELET  WITH  CRUSTS 
Combine  with  the  beaten  and  seasoned  eggs  two  tablespoon- 
fuls of  small  crusts,  cut  into  dice,  fried  in  clarified  butter,  and 
very  hot. 
Make  the  omelet  very  quickly. 
500— OMELET  WITH  SPINACH 
Stuff  the  omelet  with  two  tablespoonfuls  of  spinach  with 
cream,  and  surround  with  a  thread  of  cream  sauce. 
501— OMELET  A  LA  FERMIERE 
Add  to  the  beaten  and  seasoned  eggs  one  tablespoonful  of 
very  lean,  cooked  ham  cut  into  dice.  Pour  the  eggs  into  the 
omelet-pan,  and  cook  them  quickly,  taking  care  to  keep  them 
very  soft.  Let  the  outside  harden  slightly;  tilt  into  the  dish 
after  the  manner  of  a  pancake,  and  besprinkle  the  surface  with 
a  pinch  of  chopped  parsley. 
502— OMELET  AUX  FINES  HERBES 
Add  to  the  eggs  one  tablespoonful  of  parsley,  chervil,  chive, 
and  tarragon  leaves,  all  to  be  finely  chopped  and  almost  equally 
apportioned.

503— OMELET  WITH  VEGETABLE  MARROW  FLOWERS 
Add  to  the  eggs  one  and  one-half  oz.  of  the  calices  of 
freshly-plucked  and  young  vegetable-marrow  flowers;  cisel  and 
1 88  GUIDE  TO  MODERN  COOKERY 
stew  them,  and  add  thereto  a  pinch  of  chopped  parsley.     Sur- 
round the  omelet  with  a  thread  of  tomato  sauce. 
N.B. — This  omelet  may  be  made  with  oil,  as  well  as  with 
butter. 
504— OMELET  WITH  CHICKEN'S  LIVER 
Stuff  the  omelet  with  two  tablespoonfuls  of  chicken's  liver, 
which  should  be  cut  into  dice  or  finely  sliced,  seasoned,  quickly 
sauted  in  butter,  and  cohered  with  half-glaze.  Dish  the  omelet, 
make  an  opening  lengthwise  in  the  centre,  and  place  one  table- 
spoonful  of  chicken's  liver,  prepared  as  above,  in  the  interspaces. 
Besprinkle  with  chopped  parsley,  and  surround  the  omelet  with 
a  thread  of  half-glaze. 
S05— OMELET  WITH  ARTICHOKE = BOTTOMS 
Finely  mince  two  small  artichoke-bottoms  (raw  if  possible), 
season  them,  and  slightly  colour  them  in  butter.  Add  the

shoots  of  hops  put  aside  for  the  purpose. 
The  omelet  may  be  surrounded  with  a  thread  of  cream  sauce, 
but  this  is  optional. 
507— OMELET  A  LA  LYONNAISE 
Finely  mince  half  an  onion,  and  cook  it  with  butter  in  an 
omelet-pan,  letting  it  brown  slightly.  Add  the  eggs,  with

seasoned  raw,  rolled  in  flour,  and  sauted  in  butter  until  quite 
cooked  and  well  gilded. 
EGGS  189 
509— OMELET  WITH  MORELS 
Mince  and  toss  in  butter  two  oz.  of  very  firm  morels.  Two 
should  be  put  aside,  which,  after  having  been  cut  in  two,  length- 
wise, and  sauted  with  the  others,  should  be  placed  on  a  dish 
when  the  omelet  is  about  to  be  made.  Having  dished  the  latter, 
place  the  four  sauted  and  reserved  pieces  of  morels  upon  it,  and 
surround  it  with  a  thread  of  half-glaze. 
510— OMELET  MOUSSELINE 
Beat  the  yolks  of  three  eggs  in  a  bowl  with  a  small  pinch 
of  salt  and  a  tablespoonful  of  very  thick  cream.  Add  thereto 
the  three  whites,  whisked  to  a  stiff  froth,  and  pour  this  pre- 
paration into  a  wide  omelet-pan  containing  one  oz.  of  very  hot 
butter.  Saute  the  omelet,  tossing  it  very  quickly,  and  taking 
care  to  turn  the  outside  edges  of  the  preparation  constantly 
towards  the  centre;  when  the  whole  mass  seems  uniformly  set, 
roll  the  omelet  up  quickly,  and  dish  it.  This  omelet  should 
be  sent  to  the  table  immediately. 
510a— OMELET  WITH  MOUSSERONS 
Mince  two  oz.  of  very  fresh  mousserons ;  toss  them  in  butter 
in  the  omelet-pan ;  add  thereto  the  eggs  mixed  with  a  pinch  of 
chopped  parsley;  make  the  omelet,  dish  it,  and  surround  it  with 
a  thread  of  half-glaze. 
SI  I— OMELET  A  LA  NANTUA 
Add  to  the  omelet  six  little  crayfishes'  tails,  each  of  which 
must  be  cut  into  three,  and  the  whole  mixed  with  a  little 
Nantua  sauce.  Put  two  fine  crayfishes'  tails  on  the  omelet, 
making  them  touch  at  their  thicker  ends,  and  surround  with 
a  thread  of  Nantua  sauce. 
512— OMELET  PARMENTIER 
Add  a  pinch  of  chopped  parsley  to  the  eggs,  and,  when 
about  to  pour  the  latter  into  the  omelet-pan,  add  two  table- 
spoonfuls  of  potato  cut  into  dice,  seasoned,  sauted  in  butter, 
and  very  hot.     Make  the  omelet  in  the  usual  way.

Frizzle  with  butter,  in  the  omelet-pan,  two  oz.  of  breast  of 
bacon  cut  into  dice.  Add  to  the  eggs  one  tablespoonful  of 
finely-sliced  potatoes  sauted  in  butter,  one-half  tablespoonful  of 
ciseled  sorrel  stewed  in  butter,  and  a  pinch  of  concussed  chervil. 
Pour  the  whole  over  the  bacon-dice;  cook  the  eggs  quickly, 
I90  GUIDE  TO  MODERN  COOKERY 
keeping  them  soft;  turn  the  omelet  after  the  manner  of  a  pan- 
cake, and  tilt  it  immediately  on  to  a  round  dish. 
514— OMELET  WITH  ASPARAGUS=TOPS 
Add  one  and  one-half  tablespoonfuls  of  blanched  asparagus- 
tops,  stewed  in  butter,  to  the  omelet.  Having  dished  the  omelet, 
open  it  along  the  middle,  and  lay  a  nice  little  faggot  of 
asparagus-tops  in  the  interspace. 
S15— OMELET  A  LA  PROVEN9ALE 
Rub  the  bottom  of  the  omelet-pan  lightly  with  a  clove  of 
garlic;  put  two  tablespoonfuls  of  oil  into  the  utensil,  and  heat 
it  until  it  smokes. 
Throw  into  the  oil  a  fine,  peeled,  pressed,  and  pipped 
tomato,  cut  into  dice  and  besprinkled  with  a  pinch  of  concussed 
parsley.  Cook  it  quickly,  tossing  it  the  while,  and  add  it  to 
the  beaten  and  seasoned  eggs.  Make  the  omelet  in  the  usual 
way. 
N.B. — The  nature  of  this  preparation  demands  the  use  of 
oil  in  treating  the  tomato,  but,  failing  oil,  clarified  butter  may 
be  used. 
516— OMELET  WITH  KIDNEYS 
Add  to  the  omelet  a  tablespoonful  of  calf's  or  sheep's  kidney, 
cut  into  dice,  seasoned  with  salt  and  pepper,  sauted  quickly  in 
butter,  and  cohered  by  means  of  half-glaze.  Having  dished  the 
omelet,  divide  it  down  the  middle,  lay  some  reserved  kidney- 
dice  in  the  interspace,  and  surround  with  a  thread  of  half-glaze. 
517— OMELET  A  LA  ROSSINI 
Add  to  the  beaten  and  seasoned  eggs  one  dessertspoonful 
of  cooked  foie  gras  and  as  much  truffle,  cut  into  small  dice. 
Having  dished  the  omelet,  place  in  the  middle  thereof  a  small 
rectangular  piece  of  heated  foie  gras,  and  two  slices  of  truffle 
on  either  side  of  the  latter.  Surround  it  with  a  thread  of  half- 
glaze  flavoured  with  truffle  essence. 
518— OMELET  WITH  TRUFFLES 
Add  to  the  omelet  one  tablespoonful  of  truffles,  cut  into  dice. 
Make  the  omelet,  dish  it,  and  lay  a  row  of  fine  slices  of  truffles 
upon  it.     Surround  it  with  a  thread  of  melted  meat-glaze.

Note. — In  the  chapter  on  hors-d'oeuvres,  where  recipes  were

520— SCRAMBLED  LAPWINGS'  EGGS 
Proceed  as  for  ordinary  scrambled  eggs,  all  the  recipes  given 
for  the  latter  being  perfectly  applicable  to  lapwings'  eggs.  They 
require,  however,  very  great  care  in  their  preparation,  and  it 
should  be  borne  in  mind  that  one  ordinary  hen's  egg  is  equal 
to  about  three  lapwings'  eggs. 
521— LAPWINGS'  EGGS  A  LA  DANOISE 
Poach  the  eggs  as  directed  in  the  recipe  dealing  with  the

Proceed  as  for  other  omelets,  but  one  ordinary  hen's  egg  is 
generally  added  to  every  six  lapwings'  eggs  in  order  to  give 
more  body  to  the  preparation.  All  the  omelet  recipes  already

an  egg  upright  in  each. 
Place  a  soft-  or  hard-boiled  egg  on  each  forcemeat  tartlet, 
coat  the  eggs  with  a  light  pur^e  of  mushrooms,  besprinkle  with 
chopped  truffles,  and  arrange  in  a  circle  on  a  dish.

Garnish  each  stewed  morel  with  an  egg;  set  them  on  little 
tartlet-crusts  garnished  with  a  light,  foie-gras  pur^e,  and

Cold  Eggs 
The  preparation  of  cold  eggs  is  not  limited  by  classical 
rules;  it  rests  with  the  skill  and  artistic  imagination  of  the 
operator,  and,  since  fancifulness  and  originality  are  always 
closely  allied  to  artistic  imagination,  it  follows  that  the  varieties 
evolved  may  be  infinite. 
Indeed,  so  various  and  numerous  are  the  recipes  dealing  with 
this  kind  of  egg-preparations  that  I  must  limit  myself  to  a 
selection  only  of  the  more  customary  ones,  culled  as  far  as 
possible  from  my  own  repertory. 
525— COLD  EQQS  ALEXANDRA 
Take  some  cold,  well-trimmed,  poached  eggs ;  dry  them  and 
cover  them  with  a  white  chaud-froid  sauce.  Place  a  fine  in- 
dented slice  of  truffle  in  the  centre  of  each,  and  sprinkle  with  a 
cold,  white,  melted  aspic  jelly  until  they  are  thinly  coated  there- 
with. Slip  the  point  of  a  small  knife  round  each  egg  with  the 
view  of  moving  them  more  easily,  and  transfer  them  to  oval 
tartlet-crusts  made  from  puff-paste  trimmings,  baked  without 
colouration. 
Lay  a  border  of  caviare  round  the  eggs;  dish  them  in  the 
form  of  a  crown,  and  put  some  chopped  jelly  in  the  centre. 
526— COLD  EGGS  A  L'ANDALOUSE 
Cover  some  cold,  well-dried,  poached  eggs  with  a  tomato 
pur^e  combined  with  a  full  third  of  its  volume  of  Soubise  pur^e 
and  one-half  pint  of  melted  aspic  jelly  per  pint  of  sauce.  Cut 
some  pimentos,  marinaded  in  oil,  into  very  thin  strips,  and  lay 
these,  after  the  manner  of  a  lattice,  upon  each  egg. 
Now  garnish  as  many  oiled,  oval  tartlet-moulds  as  there 
are  eggs  with  tomato  pur^e,  thickened  with  jelly,  and  let  the 
garnish  set  on  ice.  Turn  out  the  moulds,  and  put  an  egg  upon 
each  of  the  tomato  tartlets;  arrange  the  latter  in  a  circle  on  a 
dish  surrounded  with  a  chain  composed  of  linked  rings  of  onion, 
and  garnish  the  centre  with  chopped,  white  jelly.

arrange  the  eggs  all  round. 
528— COLD  EGGS  CAPUCINE 
Carefully  dry  some  cold,  poached  eggs,  and  half-coat  them 
lengthwise  with  a  white  chaud-froid  sauce ;  complete  the  coating 
on  the  other  side  with  a  smooth  pur^e  of  truffles,  thickened  with 
jelly.  Leave  these  two  coats  to  set,  placing  the  eggs  in  the 
cool  or  on  ice  for  that  purpose. 
Garnish  the  centre  of  a  round  dish  with  a  small  pyramid  of 
cold,  truffled  Brandade  of  morue,  and  set  the  eggs  round  the 
latter. 
529— COLD  EQQS  CARfeME 
Cook  the  eggs  on  the  dish,  leave  them  to  cool,  and  trim 
them  with  an  even  fancy-cutter,  oval  in  shape.  Place  each 
egg  on  an  oval  tartlet-crust,  garnished  with  dice  of  cooked 
salmon,  cohered  with  mayonnaise. 
Surround  with  a  thread  of  caviare,  and  lay  a  thin  slice  of 
very  black  truffle  on  each  egg. 
530— COLD  EGGS  COLBERT 
Garnish  some  small,  oval  moulds  in  Chartreuse  fashion,  i.e., 
like  a  draught-board.  Put  a  small,  cold,  poached  egg  into  each 
mould,  fill  up  with  melted,  white  jelly,  and  leave  to  set.  Garnish 
the  centre  of  a  dish  with  a  heaped  vegetable  salad ;  arrange  the 
eggs  taken  from  their  moulds  around  this,  and  surround  with 
a  little  chopped  jelly. 
531— COLD  EGGS  COLINETTE 
Let  a  thin  coat  of  white  jelly  set  upon  the  bottom  and  sides 
of  some  small,  oval  moulds.  Garnish  the  latter  with  some  small 
dice,  consisting  of  white  of  &gg  and  truffles,  placing  them  so 
as  to  simulate  a  draught-board ;  now  insert  a  very  small,  cold, 
poached  egg  into  each  mould,  and  fill  up  with  a  melted  jelly. 
Garnish  the  centre  of  a  dish  with  a  "  Rachel  "  salad,  en- 
circled by  a  ring  of  sliced,  cold  potatoes,  cooked  in  water,  and 
place  the  eggs,  removed  from  their  moulds,  all  round.  Border 
the  dish  with  indented  crescents  of  white  jelly. 
532— COLD  EGGS  WITH  TARRAGON 
Mould  these  in  baba-moulds,  or  in  porcelain  cocottes ;  some 
times  they  may  simply  be  dished  up  on  small  tartlet-crusts. 
O 
194  GUIDE  TO  MODERN  COOKERY 
The  preparation  consists  of  poached  or  soft-boiled  eggs, 
garnished  with  blanched  tarragon  leaves,  or  coated  or  moulded 
with  a  very  fine  tarragon  jelly. 
533— COLD  EGGS,  FROU-FROU 
Select  soine  very  small  poached  eggs  of  equal  size,  cover 
them  with  a  white  chaud-froid  sauce  combined  with  about  a 
third  of  its  volume  of  a  pur^e  of  hard-boiled  egg-yolks. 
Garnish  the  top  of  each  egg  with  an  indented  ring  of  very 
black  truffle,  and  surround  the  base  of  the  eggs  with  a  narrow 
ribbon  composed  of  chopped  truffles.  Glaze  with  jelly,  and 
leave  to  set  on  ice. 
Prepare  a  salad  of  green  vegetables  (peas,  French  beans  cut 
into  dice  or  lozenges,  asparagus-tops) ;  thicken  it  with  a  very 
little  mayonnaise  mixed  with  melted  jelly.  Pour  this  prepara- 
tion into  an  oiled  mould,  and  leave  it  to  set.  For  dishing, 
turn  out  the  salad  in  the  middle  of  a  dish ;  surround  the  base 
with  a  line  of  chopped  jelly;  encircle  the  whole  with  the  eggs, 
letting  them  rest  on  the  jelly,  and  garnish  the  dish  with  a 
border  of  dice  cut  in  very  clear,  white  jelly. 
534— COLD  EGGS  MOSCOVITE 
Slightly  level  both  ends  of  some  shelled,  hard-boiled  eggs. 
Surround  the  tops  and  the  bases  with  three  little  anchovy  fillets, 
and  place  a  bit  of  truffle  just  half-way  along  each  egg.  Eggs 
prepared  in  this  way  resemble  little  barrels,  whereof  the  anchovy 
fillets  imitate  the  iron  hoops,  and  the  bits  of  truffle  the  bungs. 
By  means  of  a  tubular  cutter  empty  the  eggs  with  care ;  garnish 
them  with  caviare,  and  shape  the  latter  to  a  point,  outside  the 
edges  of  the  egg. 
Lay  each  egg  in  an  artichoke-bottom,  cooked  white,  and  gar- 
nished with  finely-chopped  jelly,  and  arrange  them  in  a  circle  on 
a  dish  with  chopped  jelly  in  the  centre. 
535— COLD  EGGS  A  LA  NANTUA 
Prepare  some  hard-boiled  eggs  to  resemble  little  barrels, 
after  the  manner  described  above.  For  every  six  eggs  keep 
ready  and  cold  eighteen  crayfish  cooked  k  la  Bordelaise.  Shell 
the  tails,  put  two  aside  for  each  egg,  and  cut  the  remainder  into 
dice;  finely  pound  the  bodies  and  remains,  add  thereto  three 
EGGS  195 
tablespoonfuls  of  thick  cream,  and  rub  through  tammy.  Add 
to  this  cullis  one  tablespoonful  of  thick  mayonnaise. 
Bind  the  crayfish  tails,  cut  into  dice,  with  a  few  tablespoon- 
fuls of  this  sauce,  and  garnish  the  eggs,  emptied  by  the  method 
indicated  above,  with  the  preparation  of  dice,  making  it  stand 
out  of  the  eggs  in  the  shape  of  a  small  dome.  Garnish  each 
dome  with  a  rosette  composed  of  four  halved  crayfish  tails  and 
four  truffle  lozenges. 
Glaze  well  with  jelly;  set  the  eggs  upon  artichoke-bottoms 
garnished  with  a  mayonnaise  with  crayfish  cullis,  and  arrange 
in  a  circle  on  a  dish. 
536— COLD  EQQS  POLIQNAC 
Prepare  some  eggs  a  la  Polignac,  as  explained  under 
"  Moulded  Eggs,"  and  leave  them  to  cool.  Select  some  moulds 
a  little  larger  than  those  used  in  the  cooking  of  the  eggs ;  pour 
into  each  half  a  tablespoonful  of  melted,  white  jelly,  and  leave 
to  set.  Then  put  an  egg  into  each  mould,  and  fill  up  the  space 
around  the  eggs  with  melted,  white  jelly. 
Leave  to  set,  turn  out  the  moulds,  arrange  the  mouldings 
on  a  dish,  and  surround  them  with  dice  of  faintly  coloured 
jelly. 
537— COLD  EQQS  A  LA  REINE 
Prepare  some  soft-boiled  eggs,  and  leave  them  to  cool.  Take 
as  many  cottage  brioches  as  there  are  eggs;  trim  them  to  the 
level  of  the  fluting,  and  remove  the  crumb  from  the  inside,  so 
as  to  form  little  croustades  of  them.  Garnish  the  bottom  and 
the  sides  of  these  croustades  with  a  fine  mince  of  white  chicken- 
meat,  thickened  with  mayonnaise,  and  season  moderately  with 
cayenne.  Place  a  shelled,  soft-boiled  egg  in  each  croustade ; 
coat  thinly  with  mayonnaise  slightly  thickened  by  means  of  a 
jelly;  lay  a  fine  piece  of  truffle  on  each  egg,  and,  when  the 
sauce  has  set,  glaze  with  jelly,  using  a  fine  brush  for  the 
purpose. 
Dish  up  on  a  napkin. 
538— COLD  EQQS,  RUBENS 
Season  some  cooked  young  shoots  of  hops  with  salt  and 
freshly-ground  pepper;  add  thereto  some  chopped  parsley  and 
chervil,  and  a  pur^e  of  plainly-cooked  tomatoes  combined  with 
just  sufficient  jelly  to  ensure  the  cohesion  of  the  hops.  Mould 
in  oiled  tartlet-moulds. 
o  2 
196  GUIDE  TO  MODERN  COOKERY 
Coat  some  well-dried,  cold,  poached  eggs  with  white  chaud- 
froid  sauce;  garnish  with  pieces  of  tarragon  leaves,  and  glaze 
with  jelly. 
Turn  out  the  tartlet-moulds;  set  an  egg  on  each  of  the 
mouldings,  and  arrange  them  in  a  circle  on  a  dish,  placing 
between  each  egg  a  piece  of  very  clear  jelly,  cut  to  the  shape 
of  a  cock's  comb. 
Garnish  the  centre  of  the  dish  with  chopped  jelly. 
CHAPTER      XIII 
SOUPS 
Soups  are  divided  into  two  leading  classes,  viz. : — 
1.  Clear  soups,  which  include  plain  and  garnished  con- 
sommes. 
2.  Thick  soups,  which  comprise  the  Purees,  Velout^s,  and 
Creams. 
A  third  class,  which  is  independent  of  either  of  the  above, 
inasmuch  as  it  forms  part  of  plain,  household  cookery,  em- 
braces vegetable  soups  and  Garbures  or  gratincd  soups.  But 
in  important  dinners — by  this  I  mean  rich  dinners — only  the 
first  two  classes  are  recognised. 
When  a  menu  contains  two  soups,  one  must  be  clear  and 
the  other  thick.  If  only  one  is  to  be  served,  it  may  be  either 
clear  or  thick,  in  which  case  the  two  kinds  are  represented 
alternately  at  different  meals. 
In  Part  I.  of  this  work  I  indicated  the  general  mode  of  pro- 
cedure for  consommes  and  thick  soups;  I  explained  how  the 
latter  might  be  converted  from  plain  purees  into  veloutds  or 
creams,  or  from  velout^s  into  creams ;  and  all  that  now  remains 
is  to  reveal  the  recipes  proper  to  each  of  those  soups. 
Remarks.— In  the  course  of  the  recipes  for  consommes,  given 
hereafter,  the  use  of  Royales  (Nos.  206  to  213)  and  of  Quenelles, 
variously  prepared  (Nos.  193  to  195),  will  often  be  enjoined. 
For  the  preparation  of  these  garnishes,  therefore,  the  reader  will 
have  to  refer  to  the  numbers  indicated. 
The  quantities  for  the  clear  soups  that  follow  are  all  calcu- 
lated to  be  sufficient  for  a  standard  number  of  six  people,  and 
the  quantity  of  Royales  is  always  given  in  so  many  dariole- 
moulds,  which  contain  about  one-eighth  pint,  or  baba-moidds, 
which  hold  about  one-fifth  pint. 
Of  course,  it  will  be  understood  that  the  poaching  need  not 
necessarily  have  been  effected  in  these  moulds,  for  very  small 
"Charlotte"  moulds  would  do  quite  as  well.  But  I  had  re- 
course to  the  particular  utensils  mentioned  above,  in  order  that 
198  GUIDE  TO  MODERN  COOKERY 
there  might  be  no  sort  of  doubt  as  to  the  exact  quantity  of  royale 
it  would  be  necessary  to  prepare  for  any  one  of  the  soups. 
Clear  Soups  and  Garnished  Consommes 
539— CONSOMM6  ALEXANDRA 
Have  a  quart  of  excellent  chicken  consomm6  ready;  add 
thereto,  in  order  to  thicken  it  slightly,  three  tablespoonfuls  of 
poached  tapioca,  strained  through  muslin,  and  very  clear. 
Put  the  folloM?ing  garnish  into  the  soup-tureen  :  One  table- 
spoonful  of  white  chicken-meat  cut  in  fine  julienne-fashion,  one 
tablespoonful  of  small  chicken  quenelles,  grooved  and  long  in 
shape,  and  one  tablespoonful  of  lettuce  chiffonade. 
Pour  the  boiling  consomme  upon  this  garnish,  and  send  to 
the  table  immediately. 
540— C0NS0MMI6  AMBASSADRICE 
Have  one  quart  of  chicken  consomm^  ready ;  also  there 
should  have  been  prepared  beforehand,  with  the  view  of  using 
them  quite  cold,  three  different  kinds  of  royales,  consisting 
respectively  of  truffle  pur^e,  tomato  purde,  and  pur^e  of  peas, 
each  of  which  should  have  been  poached  in  a  dariole-mould. 
Cut  these  royales  up  into  regular  dice,  and  put  them  in 
the  soup-tureen  with  one  tablespoonful  of  chicken  fillet  and 
an  equal  quantity  of  small,  freshly-cooked  mushrooms,  finely 
minced.  Pour  the  boiling  consommd  over  these  garnishes,  and 
serve  at  once. 
541— CONSOMM^   ANDALOUSE 
Prepare  a  baba-mould  of  royale  made  from  tomato  pur^e. 
When  quite  cold,  cut  it  into  dice,  and  put  these  in  the  soup- 
tureen  with  one  small  tablespoonful  of  cooked  ham  cut  in 
julienne-fashion,  one  tablespoonful  of  boiled  rice,  with  every 
grain  distinct  and  separate,  and  two  tablespoonfuls  of  threaded 
eggs  (No.  217). 
When  about  to  serve,  pour  one  quart  of  very  clear  chicken 
consomm^  over  the  garnish. 
543— CONSOMME    D'ARENBERG 
With  a  small  spoon-cutter,  pick  out  a  spoonful  of  carrot 
pellets  and  the  same  quantity  of  turnip  pellets.  Cook  these 
vegetables  by  boiling  them  in  consomm^,  taking  care  that  the 
latter  be  reduced  to  a  glaze  when  the  vegetables  are  cooked. 
SOUPS  199 
With  the  same  spoon  take  the  same  quantity  as  above  of  very 
black  truffle ;  also  prepare  a  dariole-mould  of  royale  made  from 
asparagus  heads,  and  a  dozen  small  chicken-forcemeat  quen- 
elles, which  should  be  moulded  to  the  shape  of  large  pearls. 
Poach  the  quenelles,  cut  the  royales  up  into  slices,  which 
must  be  stamped  with  an  indented  fancy-cutter,  and  put  the 
whole  into  the  soup-tureen  with  the  carrots,  turnips,  and  truffle 
pellets,  and  one  tablespoonful  of  very  green  peas. 
Pour  a  quart  of  chicken  consomm^  over  the  garnish,  and 
send  to  the  table  at  once. 
543— CONSOMME  A   LA   BOHJ&MIENNE 
Prepare  three  dariole-moulds  of  foie-gras  pur^e,  and  twelve 
■profiterolles  (No.  218)  of  the  size  of  hazel-nuts,  the  latter  being 
made  very  crisp. 
When  the  royale  is  cold,  cut  it  into  little,  regular  squares, 
and  put  these  into  the  soup-tureen. 
When  about  to  serve,  pour  over  this  garnish  a  quart  of 
chicken  consomm^,  thickened  by  means  of  three  tablespoonfuls 
of  tapioca,  poached  and  strained  through  linen. 
Send  the  profiterolles  to  the  table  separately,  and  very  hot. 
544— CONSOMMlfe   BOiELDIEU 
Prepare  eighteen  chicken-forcemeat  quenelles,  moulded  by 
means  of  a  small  teaspoon ;  some  should  be  stuffed  with  foie- 
gras  pur^e,  moistened  with  a  little  veIout6 ;  others  with  chicken 
pur^e;  and  yet  others  with  truffle  pur^e — in  short,  six  of  each 
kind. 
Place  these,  one  by  one,  on  a  buttered  saut6-pan ;  poach 
them,  drain  them,  and  put  them  in  the  soup-tureen  with  a 
tablespoonful  of  white  chicken-meat,  cut  into  dice. 
When  about  to  serve,  pour  one  quart  of  chicken  consomm^, 
thickened  as  above  with  tapioca,  over  the  garnish. 
545— CONSOMME    BOUQUETlfeRE 
Prepare  a  garnish  of  carrots  and  turnips,  cut  with  the 
tubular  cutter  or  with  the  spoon ;  French  beans  cut  into  lozenges, 
asparagus-heads,  and  green  peas,  all  of  which  vegetables  should 
be  fresh  and  young.  Cook  each  vegetable  according  to  its 
nature,  and  put  the  whole  into  the  soup-tureen. 
When  about  to  serve,  pour  over  the  garnish  one  quart  of 
chicken  consomm6  thickened  with  two  tablespoonfuls  of 
tapioca,  poached  and  strained  through  fine  linen. 
200  GUIDE  TO  MODERN  COOKERY 
546— CONSOMMI6   BOURDALOUE 
Prepare  a  dariole-mould  of  each  of  the  four  following 
royales  : — 
1.  Of  a  pur^e  of  haricot-beans  with  a  slight  addition  of 
tomato. 
2.  Of  a  chicken  pur^e  moistened  with  velout6. 
3.  Of  a  puree  of  asparagus-tops  combined  with  a  few  cooked 
spinach  leaves,  to  deepen  the  colour. 
4.  Of  a  carrot  pur^e  (Pur^e  Crecy). 
Having  poached  and  cooled  the  royales,  cut  them  as 
follows  : — 
(i)  Into  dice,  (2)  into  lozenges,  (3)  into  little  leaves,  and 
(4)  into  stars. 
Place  them  all  in  the  ^oup-tureen,  and,  when  about  to 
serve,  pour  one  quart  of  boiling  and  very  clear  chicken  con- 
somme over  them. 
547— POTAQE  BORTSCH 
Cut  in  julienne-fashion  the  heads  of  two  leeks,  one  carrot, 
half  of  an  onion,  four  oz.  of  the  white  of  cabbage  leaves,  half 
a  root  of  parsley,  the  white  part  of  a  stick  of  celery,  and  four  oz. 
of  beetroot ;  set  the  whole  to  stew  gently  in  butter. 
Moisten  with  one  quart  of  white  consommd  and  two  or  three 
tablespoonfuls  of  the  juice  of  grated  beetroot;  add  a  small 
bunch  of  fennel  and  sweet  marjoram,  two  lbs.  of  moderately 
fat  breast  of  beef,  and  the  half  of  a  semi-roasted  duck ;  set  to 
cook  gently  for  four  hours. 
When  about  to  serve,  cut  the  breast  of  beef  into  large  dice, 
and  cut  the  duck  into  small  slices;  finish  the  soup  with  one- 
quarter  pint  of  beetroot  juice,  extracted  from  grated  beetroot 
pressed  in  linen,  and  a  little  blanched  and  chopped  fennel  and 
parsley.  Put  the  beef  dice  and  sliced  duck  into  the  soup,  with 
twelve  grilled  and  despumated  chipolatas. 
Serve,  separately,  a  sauceboat  of  sour  cream. 
N.B. — The  chipolatas  may  be  replaced  by  very  small  patties 
with  duck  forcemeat,  which  should  be  served  separately. 
548— CONSOMME  BRUNOISE 
Cut  into  small  dice  the  red  part  only  of  two  small  carrots, 
one  small  turnip,  the  heads  of  two  leeks,  a  small  stick  of  celery, 
and  the  third  of  an  onion  of  medium  size.

sugar,  and  stew  them  in  butter.     Moisten  with  one-half  pint 
SOUPS  20 1 
of  consomm6,  and  complete  the  cooking  of  the  Brunoise  gently. 
Five  minutes  before  serving,  finish  with  one  quart  of  boiling, 
ordinary  consomm^,  a  moderate  tablespoonful  of  peas,  and  the 
same  quantity  of  French  beans,  cut  into  dice  and  kept  very 
green. 
Pour  into  the  soup-tureen,  and  add  a  pinch  of  fine  chervil 
pluches. 
549— CONSOMME  CARMEN 
Prepare  one  quart  of  consomm^,  to  which  add,  while  clarify- 
ing, one-quarter  pint  of  raw  tomato  pur^e,  in  order  to  give  it 
a  faint,  pink  tinge. 
Also  peel  and  press  a  small  and  rather  firm  tomato ;  cut  into 
dice,  and  poach  the  latter  in  some  of  the  consomm^ ;  put  them 
in  the  soup-tureen  with  a  small  tablespoonful  of  mild  capsicum, 
cut  in  fine  julienne-fashion,  and  one  tablespoonful  of  plain- 
boiled  rice. 
When  about  to  serve,  pour  the  boiling  consomm^  over  the 
garnish,  and  add  a  small  pinch  of  chervil  pluches. 
550— CONSOMME   CASTELLANE 
Prepare  (i)  one  quart  of  game  consomm6,  flavoured  with  a 
fumct  of  woodcock;  (2)  two  baba-moulds  of  royale,  two-thirds 
of  which  consists  of  a  pur^e  of  woodcock  and  one-third  of 
lentils,  with  half  the  yolk  of  a  hard-boiled  egg,  chopped  and 
thickened  with  the  usual  leason. 
Cut  this  royale  into  slices,  about  the  size  of  a  florin,  one- 
half  inch  thick.  Put  these  into  the  soup-tureen,  together  with 
one  tablespoonful  of  a  julienne  of  roast  woodcock  fillets,  and 
pour  thereon  the  boiling  game  consomm^. 
551— CONSOMME   CELESTINE 
Prepare  one  quart  of  chicken  consomme,  and  add  thereto 
three  small  tablespoonfuls  of  poached  tapioca,  strained  through 
fine  linen. 
For  the  garnish  make  three  pannequets  (No.  2476)  without 
sugar,  and  spread  over  each  a  thin  coating  of  chicken  force- 
meat with  cream.  Place  one  on  top  of  the  other,  sprinkle  the 
layer  of  forcemeat  on  the  uppermost  one  with  finely-chopped, 
very  black  truffles,  and  place  in  the  front  of  the  oven  for  a  few 
minutes,  in  order  to  poach  the  forcemeat. 
Stamp  the  panncqtiets  out  with  an  even  fancy-cutter  about 
one  inch  in  diameter.  Put  the  pieces  into  a  soup-tureen,  and, 
\yhgn  about  to  serve,  pour  in  the  boiling  consornfp<J, 
202  GUIDE  TO  MODERN  COOKERY 
552— CONSOMMl^   CHARTREUSE 
Prepare  (i)  eighteen  small  ravioles  (No.  2296) — six  from 
spinach  purde,  six  from  foie-gras  purde,  and  the  remaining  six 
from  chopped  mushrooms;  (2)  two  small  tablespoonfuls  of 
tomato  dice.  Ten  minutes  before  serving,  poach  the  ravioles 
in  boiling,  salted  water,  and  the  tomato  dice  in  some  of  the 
consomm^. 
Put  the  ravioles  and  the  tomato  dice  (well  drained)  into  the 
soup-tureen,  and  pour  over  them  one  quart  of  consomm^  with 
a  moderate  addition  of  tapioca.     Add  a  pinch  of  chervil  pluches. 
553— C0NS0MM6  AUX  CHEVEUX  D'ANGE 
About  two  minutes  before  serving,  plunge  three  oz.  of  very 
fine  vermicelli,  known  as  Angel's  Hair  (Cheveux  d'Ange)  into 
one  quart  of  excellent,  boiling  consomm^. 
An  instant  only  is  needed  to  poach  the  vermicelli,  and  the 
latter  does  not  require  to  be  blanched. 
This  soup,  like  those  containing  pastes,  should  be  accom- 
panied by  freshly-grated  Parmesan  cheese. 
554— CONSOMME  COLBERT 
Have  ready  one  quart  of  excellent  Printanier  chicken  con- 
somm6  (No.  601).  Also  poach  six  small  eggs  in  slightly  salted 
and  acidulated  water.  The  eggs  should  be  as  small  and  as 
fresh  as  possible,  both  of  which  conditions  are  absolutely  neces- 
sary for  a  proper  poaching  (see  poached  eggs.  No.  411).  Set 
these  eggs  in  a  small  timbale  with  a  little  consomm^,  and  send 
them  to  the  table  with  the  Printanier.  Having  poured  the 
latter  into  the  plates,  put  one  of  the  eggs  into  each  of  these.
