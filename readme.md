# An Interactive Guide to Modern Cookery


### Introduction
**An Interactive Guide to Modern Cookery** is a technical exploration and functional prototype designed to reimagine how we interact with traditional cookbooks. By leveraging modern natural language processing and retrieval techniques, this project transforms static recipe texts into a searchable, conversational experience.

At its core, this guide uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow users to query recipes and cooking techniques naturally, receiving helpful, context-aware responses generated by a language model. Behind the scenes, recipes are extracted from scanned PDF cookbooks, structured into machine-readable formats, embedded into a vector database, and retrieved based on semantic relevance.

Whether you're a curious home cook, a developer interested in language models, or a culinary historian exploring digital interfaces for classic texts, this project offers a glimpse into how AI can enhance the accessibility and personalization of culinary knowledge.

### Setup Instructions



### A Guide To What's Been Done
1) Data Extraction from PDFs of Cookbooks 
    - Extracted r   ecipes and stored them in a structured manner. 
        - Extracted text using `PyMuPDF`.
        - Identified recipes and key information using Python's Regular Expression module `re`.
        - Stored recipes using JSON format.
    - See `data extraction.ipynb`.

2) Implemented Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 
    - Stored the structured recipes in a vector database.
        - Used `ChromaDB`.
    - Used embedding models to index and retrieve relevant recipes based on user queries.
        - Embeddings computed via `mxbai-embed-large:latest` and `Ollama`.
    - Used retrieved data to and an LLM to generate responses.
        - Responses generated via `llama3:latest`.
    - See `rag.ipynb`.

3) Frontend and UI
    - Built a basic chat interface using `Gradio`.


### Future plans: 
- Typo fixes for the OCR of the original document.
    - Will use SymSpell to handle multilingual text by combining the French and English frequency dictionaries.
- NER on the recipes for filtering based on ingredients and methods.
- Develop tests to quantify retrieval and compare various models and embedding methods.
- Compare different embedding models.
- Compare different LLM models.
- Evaluate the necessity of a chunking method for longer recipes.
- Add a chat history for developing recipes
- Add a feature for users to save recipes they've developed.
- Add a feature to load saved recipes for further development or modification.
- Find other public domain cookbooks for other cuisines (e.g. if Marcella Hazan's "Essentials of Italian Cooking" were public domain).
