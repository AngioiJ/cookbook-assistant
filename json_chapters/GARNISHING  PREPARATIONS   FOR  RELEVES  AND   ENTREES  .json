        "instructions": "These are the same as the croquettes, though they are differently treated. They are made on a floured board in the shape of diminutive cottage-loaves, little shuttle-shaped loaves, small quoits, and lozenges or rectangles. They are gilded with beaten egg, and when their shape is that of quoits, rectangles, or lozenges, they are streaked by means of a small knife. After this operation, which is to prevent the gilding from blistering, they are baked in the oven for a few minutes previous to being used in dressing the dishes they accompany."

        "instructions": "Take one lb. of croquette paste and add thereto six oz. of very red, reduced tomato-puree. Pour this mixture into a bag fitted with a large, grooved pipe, and squeeze it out upon a baking-tray in shapes resembling large meringues. Slightly gild their surfaces with beaten egg, and put them into the oven for a few minutes before using them to dress the dish."

        "instructions": "The uses of Duxelle are legion, and it is prepared thus: — Slightly fry one teaspoonful of onions in one tablespoonful of butter and oil mixed. Add to this four tablespoonfuls of mush- room stalks and parings, chopped and well pressed in a towel with the view of expelling their vegetable moisture. Stir over a brisk fire until the latter has completely evaporated; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and one coffeespoonful of well- chopped parsley, mixing the whole thoroughly. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a piece of white, buttered paper, and put aside until wanted."

        "instructions": "This preparation serves chiefly for covering certain large joints of butcher's meat, or fowl, to which it imparts an appro- priate flavour. It is made as follows : — Finely mince two medium carrots (the red part only), two onions, and two sticks of celery taken from the heart. Add one tablespoonful of raw lean ham, cut paysanne-fashion, a sprig of thyme, and half a leaf of bay, crushed. Stew in butter, and finally swill the saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of Madeira."

        "instructions": "The purpose of Mirepoix in culinary preparations is the same as that of Matignon, but its mode of use is different. Its constituents are the same as those of the Matignon, but instead of being minced they are cut up into more or less fine dice, in accordance with the use for which the preparation is intended. Instead of the ham, fresh and slightly-salted breast of pork may be used, while both the ham and the bacon may be ex- cluded under certain circumstances."

        "title": "FINE OR BORDELAISE MIREPOIX",
        "instructions": "Coarse Mirepoix, which are added to certain preparations in order to lend these the proper flavour, are generally made immediately before being used, but this is not so in the case of the finer Mirepoix, which chiefly serves as an adjunct to crayfish and lobsters, This is made in advance, and as follows : — Cut into dice four oz. of the red part only of carrots, the same quantity of onion, and one oz. of parsley stalks. In order that the Mirepoix may be still finer, these ingredients may now be chopped, but in this case it is advisable to tho- roughly press them in a corner of a towel, so as to squeeze out their vegetable moisture, the mere process of stewing not being sufficient for this purpose. Should this water be allowed to remain in the Mirepoix, more particularly if the latter must be kept some time, it would probably give rise to mustiness or fermentation. Put the ingredients into a small stewpan with one and one- half oz. of butter and a little powdered thyme and bay, and stew until all are well cooked. This done, turn the preparation out into a small bowl, heap it together with the back of a fork, cover it with a piece of white, buttered paper, and put aside until wanted."

        "title": "VARIOUS SALPICONS",
        "instructions": "This term stands for a certain preparatory method applied to a series of preparations. Salpicons are simple or compound. Simple if they only con- tain one product, such as the meat of a fowl, or of game, butcher's meat, foie gras, various fish, ham or tongue, mush- rooms, truffles, &c. Compound if they consist of two or more of the above-mentioned ingredients which may happen to combine suitably. The preparatory method consists in cutting the various in- gredients into dice. The series of preparations arises from the many possible com- binations of the products, each particular combination bearing its own name. Thus Salpicons may be Royal, Financier, Chasseur, Parisien, Montglas, &c. ; of whichever kind, however, Salpicons are always incorporated with a vehicular sauce which is in accord- ance with their constituents."

        "instructions": "Put into a bowl one lb. of sifted flour, one-quarter oz. of salt, one tablespoonful of oil or melted butter, and the necessary quantity of barely lukewarm water. If the batter is to be used at once mix the ingredients by turning them over and over with- out stirring with the spoon, for this would give the preparation an elasticity which would prevent its adhering to immersed solids. Should the batter be prepared beforehand, however, it may be stirred, since it loses its elasticity when left to stand any length of time. Before using it add the whites of two eggs whisked to a froth."

        "title": "THE PREPARATION OF SOUPS",
        "instructions": "The nutritious liquids known under the name of Soups are of comparatively recent origin. Indeed, as they are now served, they do not date any further back than the early years of the nineteenth century. The soups of old cookery were, really, complete dishes, wherein the meats and vegetables used in their preparation were assembled. They, moreover, suffered from the effects of the general confusion which reigned in the menus of those days. These menus seem to have depended in no wise, for their items, upon the progressive satisfaction of the consumers' appetites, and a long procession of dishes was far more characteristic of the meal tlian their judicious order and diversity. In this respect, as in so many others, Careme was the re- former, and, if he were not, strictly speaking, the actual initiator of the changes which ushered in our present methods, he cer- tainly had a large share in the establishment of the new theories. Nevertheless, it took his followers almost a century to bring soups to the perfection of to-day, for modern cookery has replaced those stodgy dishes of yore by comparatively simple and savoury preparations which are veritable wonders of delicacy and taste. Now, my attention has been called to the desirability of drawing up some sort of classification of soups, if only with the view of obviating the absurdity of placing such preparations as are in- discriminately called Bisque, Puree, CuUis, or Cream under the same head. Logically, each preparation should have its own special formula, and it is impossible to admit that one and the same can apply to all. It is generally admitted that the terms Veloutes and Creams, whose introduction into the vocabulary of cookery is comparatively recent, are peculiarly well suited to sup- plant those of Bisque and Cullis, which are steadily becoming obsolete, as well as that too vulgar term Puree.
