Extract the butter-milk, which is always present in more or less large quantities. 2. Make it sufficiently soft to mix with the various in- gredients of which the pastes are made up. Pomaded Butter. — After having well softened it as above, put it in a bowl or basin, previously rinsed with hot water and thoroughly wiped. Work the butter with a spatula or a wooden spoon until it acquires the consistence of a pomade — a necessary condition for certain of its uses. Clarified Butter. — In pastry, clarified butter is used more especially for the buttering of moulds. Put the butter to be clarified into a saucepan, and cook it over a very slow fire until (i) the caseoUs substances liberated in the cooking process have accumulated and solidified on the bottom of the saucepan ; (2) it appears litrlpid, of a golden colour, and exhales a slight, nutty smell.

Clarified butter, owing to its purity, is the best for the purpose. It may be applied with a brush, care being taken that all the inside surfaces get uniformly covered with it. One unbuttered spot is sufficient to make a moulding stick, or to completely spoil a cake. For certain cakes, chopped or splintered almonds are sprinkled in the mould. For others, especially biscuits, the moulds are flour-dusted — that is to say, a veil of very dry flour or fecula is allowed to settle on the layer of butter, which, at the turning out, appears like a glazed crust upon the cake."

When required, the blending of these colours yields the intermediate tones. The colours may be bought. Y Y 2344_THE COOKINQ OF SUGAR From the state of syrup to the most highly-concentrated state in which it is used in pastry sugar passes through various stages of cooking, which are : — The small thread (215° F.) and the large thread (222° F,), the small ball (236° F.) and the large ball (248° F.), the small crack (285° F.) and the large crack (315° F.). When the last state is overreached, the sugar has become caramel (360° F.). Put the necessary quantity of loaf sugar in a small, copper saucepan ; moisten with enough water to melt it, and boil. Carefully remove the scum which forms, and which might cause the sugar to granulate. e '\"\" ~ / As soorTasetlie sugar begins to move stiffly in boiling, it is a sign that the water has almost entirely evaporated, and that ; the real cooking of the sugar has begun. \\ From this moment, with moistened fingers or a little piece of moistened linen, take care to remove the crystallised sugar from the sides of the utensil, lest it makes the remaining portion turn. The cooking of the sugar then progresses very rapidly, and the states of its various stages, coming one upon the other in quick succession at intervals of a few minutes, may be ascer- tained as follows : — It has reached the small-thread stage, when a drop of it held between the thumb and the first finger fornris smalT resistless strings_when the thumb and finger are drawn apart. —~-— it has reached the large-thread stage, when, proceeding in the same way, the strings formed between the parted finger and thumb are more numerous and stronger. From this moment recourse must be had to cold water in order to ascertain the states of the sugar. When a few minutes have elapsed after the test for the large- thread state, dip the end of the first finger, first into cold water, then into the sugar, and plunge it again immediately into the bowl of cold water, which should be ready at hand. The sugar taken from the finger forms a kind of soft ball, and it is this state which is called the small ball. When, upon repeating the procedure, the sugar removed from the finger rolls into a firmer ball, the large-ball stage is reached. After the cooking has continued for a few seconds longer, the sugar lying on the finger peels off in the form of a thin, flexible film, which sticks to the teeth. This is the small-crack Uage. Tests should then be made in quick succession, until the film taken from the end of the finger breaks \"clean \" in the teeth, like glass. This is the large-crack state, the last of the cooking stages, and as soon as it has been reached the utensil should be taken off the fire, lest a few seconds more turn the sugar to caramel. To prevent the granulating of the sugar, a few drops of lemon fuice may be ad3ea to it ; or. better still, a taBlespoorifiil of glucose, per lb."

Moisten with just enough water to melt the sugar, and set to cook as directed under \" The Cooking of Sugar.\" Stop the cooking precisely at 230° F. between the large- thread stage and the small-ball stage, and pour the sugar on a moderately-oiled marble slab. Let it half cool for a few minutes; then, with a spatula, move it about well in all direc- tions, taking care that no portion of the sugar on the marble is left untouched by the spatula, for any such portion would harden and form lumps in the Fondant. After ten to fifteen minutes' work with the spatula, the sugar should have become a white, slightly granulated paste. Heap the latter together, and scrape the marble slab with the blade of a strong knife. Carefully work this paste (No. 2357) with the palm of the hand until it is very thin and smooth, whereupon the Fondant is ready for use. Y Y 2 It need now only be heaped in a receptacle, covered with a damp cloth, and kept somewhat dry. To Glaze -with \" Fondant.\" — Put the required amount of it into a saucepan ; work it over a slow fire for a while, in order to soften it, and moisten it, little by little, with water when a dry flavour or an essence is used, or, otherwise, with the selected liqueur. Warm slightly in order to make the glaze very liquid and to ensure its speedy drying, and pour it, at one tilt, over the object to be glazed. With the help of some colour, the glaze is generally given the tint of the fruit which flavours it. 2346a— SUCRE EN GLACE (Icing Sugar) This is sugar strained through a silken drum-sieve. The sugar strained through this silk has the delicacy of starch. At times it is used instead of Fondant for the glazing of cakes, but it is mostly used for white and caramel glazings. For this purpose the sugar is held in a tin box, covered with a lid pierced with small holes, called a sugar dredger. To glaze white is to cover a cake, a fritter, or other object with a coat of icing sugar. This operation is effected by shak- ing the sugar dredger over the object to be glazed. To glaze with caramel is to cover a Souffle, a souffled omelet, fruit fritters, a custard, Pannequets, or other objects with a coat of icing sugar. By placing the sugar-coated object in fierce heat, a few minutes suffice to melt the sugar, which is con- verted into a brilliant covering of caramel."

Mass the paste together, and let it rest for twenty minutes, that it may lose its elasticity, which will be all the more pronounced for its having been very much worked. It is to avoid this elasticity, therefore, that the mixing of puff-paste should be effected with the smallest amount of kneading possible. (2) Spread the prepared paste on a flour-dusted board, in the shape of an even galette. Spread thereon one lb. of softened butter, without completely covering the paste; draw the edges of the paste towards the centre, in such wise as to enclose the butter completely, and to form a square thickness of paste. (3) Leave to rest for a further ten minutese and then begin the working of the paste ; rolling it out to the length of one and one-half feet, and keeping it one in. thick. Fold this layer over thrice, and press upon it with the roller so as to join the super- posed layers. The whole of this operation constitutes one turn. Begin another turn immediately, turning the paste the re- verse way, and folding it.as before. Set it to rest in the cool for eight or ten minutes, and then effect two more turns. Ten minutes after the two last turns (there should be six in all), the puffepaste is ready to be cut up and used. Remarks relative to puff-paste : Good puff-paste should be buttered to the extent of one lb. per one and one-half lbs., i.e., one lb. of butter for every one lb. of flour mixed with one-half pint of water. The consistence of the paste and the butter should be exactly the same, if they are to be evenly mixed ; the butter ought therefore to be softened — more particularly in witater. In preparing puff-paste, remember to put it in a cool place while it is resting ; but never directly upon ice ; for, though the ice would not affect the paste, it might seriously affect the butter. It would harden it to the extent of preventing its perfect mixture with the mass, and lumps would form. Puff-paste should be rolled out very regularly, with the view of thoroughly distributing the butter throughout the preparation, and thus ensuring its uniform rising. Puff-paste should not be worked too speedily ; for, if it be so worked, it will be found to acquire an elasticity which not only- makes it difficult to cut up, but also tends to make it shrink in the baking."

        "instructions": "Quantities: One lb. of flour; twelve oz. of butter; one-half oz. of very dry, fresh yeast; eight eggs; about one-third pint of milk; one-half oz. of salt, and one oz. of sugar. Procedure : Savarin paste may be prepared in several ways; but the one given below is as simple and expeditious as could' be desired. Sift the flour into a basin (or a round wooden bowl, better suited to the work) ; hollow it out ; add the yeast, and dissolve the latter by means of tepid milk, stirring slightly with the tip of the finger. Add the eggs ; mix the whole ; work the paste by hand for a few minutes ; detach those portions of it which have adhered to the side of the utensil, and add them to the whole. Distribute the softened butter in small quantities over the paste. Cover, and place in a temperate room until the paste has grown to twice its original bulk. Then add salt; knead the paste, that it may thoroughly absorb the butter, and pat it briskly until it is sufficiently elastic to be taken up in one lump. At this stage add the sugar, and work the paste again that the former may thoroughly mix with it. The sugar should only be added at the close of the operation ; for, since it impairs the cohesiveness of the paste, it would render the latter much more difHcult to work were it added at the start. THE USES OF THIS PASTE If it be for Savarins with syrup, it is customary to sprinkle the previously-buttered moulds with slightly-grilled, chopped or splintered almonds. Take the paste in small quantities at a time, and line the moulds with it to the extent of one-third of their height. The remaining two-thirds of each mould become covered when the paste rises owing to fermentation. Proceed in the same way for Savarins which are to be kept dry, for fruit crusts or other uses; but then the sprinkling of the moulds with almond may be omitted."

        "recipe_id": "2397",
        "title": "CREME ANQLAISE",
        "instructions": "This custard allows of various methods of preparation which are subject to the purpose for which it is intended. It is the chief sauce for entremets, and whether it be poached in a deep dish or in a mould, it constitutes one of the oldest and best- known entremets. This last kind of custard will be examined hereafter. At present I shall only deal with the variety used either as a sauce or an accompaniment, cold or hot. It is extremely difficult to prescribe lixed quantities for this custard, for the former depend a great deal upon the consumers' tastes, and, whereas some like a thick custard, others go to the extreme of wishing it just liquid enough to be drunk like any other beverage. The quantities given below are suited to a custard of medium consistence, but if a thicker custard were desired, the number of egg-yolks would have to be proportionately increased, and vice-versa. The quantity of sugar also varies, subject to the consumers' tastes, and, as the amount used (except in the case of unreason- able excess) does not affect the consistence of the custard, it may be graduated from three to ten or twelve oz. per quart, as taste may dictate. Six oz. of sugar per quart of milk constitutes a happy medium. English custard admits of all the aromatic essences used for entremets, but the one which suits it best is vanilla. When this last-named flavour or that of filberts, almond pralin, or coffee is used, it is well to put the required quantity to infuse for twenty minutes in the boiling milk, after the latter has been measured off. Chocolate is first melted and then gradually added to the custard before it is cooked. Other aromatic essences or liqueurs are added to the custard after it has been strained. English custard admits of two methods of preparation : — Recipe A. — Put twelve raw egg-yolks and three-quarters lb. of powdered sugar in a bowl. Mix the sugar a little with the yolks, and stir the latter briskly with a spatula until they have entirely absorbed the sugar, and the resulting paste is white and has reached the ribbon stage. Then pour one quart of boiling milk into the paste, little by little, mixing the whole the while with a whisk. Then put the preparation on the fire, stirring it with a spatula, and cook it until it approaches the boil and properly coats the withdrawn spoon. Take care not to let it boil, for this would turn the preparation. In an)'e case, when the sauce is intended for hot sweets, by adding a tablespoonful of arrowroot, it may be prevented from turning. When the custard is cooked, as already explained, strain it, either through a strainer, into a bain-marie, if it is to be served hot, or through a sieve into a large, enamelled basin, where it should be frequently stirred to be kept smooth while cooling. Custard prepared in this way forms the base of all ice- creams, of which I shall speak later on. It may serve as an adjunct to all cold or hot sweets which allow of a sauce. When, while it is still lukewarm, it is combined with its weight of best butter, it constitutes the delicious butter cream, which is the richest and most delicate of the pastry-cook's confections. Finally, if eight melted gelatine leaves per quart of cooled milk be added to it, and it be mixed with twice its volume of whipped cream, it represents the preparation for \" Cream Bavarois \" and \" Russian Charlottes.\" Recipe B. — Melt six oz. of sugar in one quart of milk; boil, and pour the mixture, little by little, over twelve egg-yolks, whisking the latter briskly the while. When this custard is to be moulded, or is intended for a Cabinet Pudding, or some other similar preparation, which must be ultimately poached, strain it as soon as it is mixed, without cooking it. If, on the other hand, it be intended for an accompaniment, or for the preparation of butter creams or ices, cook it as directed in Recipe A."

N.B. — The addition of a little dissolved or powdered traga- canth gum to the cream allows of a more frothy cream being obtained, but the result is neither as fresh nor as perfect in taste when it is not combined with a sweet or ice preparation.

        "instructions": "Preparation A. — Put into a basin one lb. of sifted flour, six oz. of powdered sugar, and a pinch of table-salt. Dilute with ten eggs and one quart of milk, added by degrees. Flavour with one heaped tablespoonful of orange, lemon or vanilla sugar, which should form part of the total weight of sugar prescribed ; or with one-eighth pint of some liqueur such as brandy, kirsch, rum, &c., which should form part of the total moistening. Preparation B. — Dilute one lb. of flour, three and one-half oz. of powdered sugar and a pinch of salt, with nine eggs and a half- pint of cream. Add one-eighth pint of brandy, two and a half- oz. of melted butter and one and a half-pints of milk. Pass the whole through a fine strainer, and finish it with one-eighth pint of orgeat syrup (or almond milk) and three oz. of finely-crushed macaroons. Preparation C. — Dilute one lb. of flour, three and a half oz. of powdered sugar and a pinch of table salt in nine eggs. Stir the mixture well ; add to it a half-pint of raw cream and one pint of milk. Finish with a half-pint of whipped cream, and flavour as fancy may suggest. Preparation D. — Dilute one lb. of flour, three and a half oz. of powdered sugar and a pinch of salt, in five eggs and the yolks of three. Add one and three-quarter pints of milk and five egg- whites whisked to a stiff froth. Flavour according to fancy. Wash one lb. of Carolina or Patna rice ; cover it with plenty of cold water ; boil, and drain it the moment it has boiled. Wash it once more in lukewarm water ; drain it, and set it to cook with two pints of boiled milk, two-thirds lb. of sugar, a pinch of salt and three oz. of butter. Flavour with a stick of vanilla or a few strips of orange or lemon rind, strung together with cotton. When the liquor begins to boil, cover the saucepan ; place it in the oven, and let it cook gently for twenty or twenty-five minutes, without once touching the rice the while. On withdrawing it from the oven, thicken it with the yolks of sixteen eggs, which should be mixed with it by means of a fork in such wise as not to break the rice grains, which ought to remain whole. N.B. — In some cases, the milk and the sugar may be re- placed (for the cooking process) by an equal amount of syrup at 12\" (Saccharometer)."

        "instructions": "Souffle preparations are of two kinds : — (i) Those prepared with cream, which if necessary may serve for all souffles ; (2) those with a fruit-puree base, which allow of a more pronounced flavour for fruit souff.es than if these were prepared with cream. Cream-souffle Preparation for Four People. — Boil one-sixth pint of milk with one oz. of sugar ; add a tablespoonful of flour diluted in a little cold milk ; cook for two minutes, and finish, away from the fire, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and two egg-yolks with three whites whisked to a stiff froth. Souffle Preparation for a Big Party. — Thoroughly mix half-lb. of flour, half-lb. of sugar, four eggs and the yolks of three, in a saucepan. Dilute with one quart of boiling milk ; add a stick of vanilla ; boil, and cook for two minutes, stirring incessantly the while. Finish, away from the fire, with four oz. of butter, five cgg- yolks, and twelve whites, whisked to a very stiff froth. Souffli Preparation with a Fruit Base. — Take one lb. of sugar cooked to the small-crack stage ; add thereto one lb. of the pulp or puree of the fruit under treatment, and ten egg-whites, beaten to a stiff froth. Proceed thus : Having cooked the sugar to the extent stated above, add to it the fruit pulp. If the latter reduces the sugar a stage or two, cook it afresh in order to return it to the small- crack stage ; and, when this is reached, pour it over the whites. Dishing and Cooking of Soufflis. — Whatever the souffles may consist of, dish them in a timbale, or in a special false-bottomed dish, buttered and sugared inside. Cook in a somewhat moderate oven, that the heat may reach the centre of the soufHe by degrees. Two minutes before withdrawing the soufifld from the oven, sprinkle it with icing sugar, which, when it becomes caramel upon the surface of the souffl6, constitutes the glazing. The decoration of souffles is optional, and, in any case, should not be overdone. Hot Sauces for Entremets"

Treat the resulting pieces of custard twice d, tanglaise, using very fine and fresh bread- crumbs for the purpose. Press upon the bread-crumbs with the blade of a knife that they may adhere properly, and fry the pieces of cream in very hot fat. On taking the fritters out of the fat, sprinkle them with icing sugar, and dish them on a napkin. N.B. — Instead of treating these fritters a I'anglaise, they may be dipped into batter and treated as directed in the case of Apricot fritters. 2nd Alethod. — Prepare a custard as for a \" creme renversee \" (No. 2639), using only whole eggs, that it may be firm ; and poach it in a utensil of a shape which will facilitate the cutting-up of the preparation. When the latter is quite cool, cut it up as fancy may suggest ; dip the pieces in batter (No. 234) and plunge them in plenty of hot fat. Drain them on a piece of linen ; sprinkle them with icing sugar ; glaze them in a fierce oven, and dish them on a napkin. \"erd Method. — Prepare some common-shaped meringues, and keep them very dry. When they have cooled, open them slightly on top, and, through the hole in each, fill them either with a Bavarois preparation, with some kind of ice-cream, or with a fruit salpicon thickened with stewed apricots or plums. Close the holes with the pieces that were cut out, and place the meringues in the refrigerator for an hour. When about to serve them, quickly treat them d Panglaise ; set them (opened side uppermost) in a frying-basket, and dip them for a few seconds in smoking fat.

This preparation is, moreover, combined with a puree of fruit suited to the pudding. Procedure : Butter a mould ; set it in a bain-marie, and pour a few table-spoonfuls of the above preparation into it. Let it set, and upon this set custard sprinkle a layer of suitable fruit, sliced. This fruit may be apricots, peaches, pears, etc. Cover the fruit with a fresh cpat of custard, but more copiously than in the first case ; let this custard set as before ; cover it with fruit, and proceed in the same order until the mould is full. It is, in short, another form of aspic-jelly preparation, but hot instead of cold. If the solidification of the layers of custard were not ensured, the fruit would fall to the bottom of the mould instead of remaining distributed between the layers of custard, and the result would be the collapse of the pudding as soon as it was turned out.

When they are greased they are incrusted in broken ice after the prepara- tion has been covered with a round sheet of white paper. When about to serve, the mould is quickly plunged into tepid water, wiped, and turned out upon a dish, which may or may not be covered with a folded napkin. Instead of oiling the moulds they may be covered with a thin coat of sugar, cooked to the caramel stage, which besides making the Bavarois sightly, also gives it an excellent taste. Another very advisable method is that of serving the Bavarois in a deep silver timbale or dish, surrounded with ice. In this case, the entremet not having to be turned out, the preparation does not need to be so cohesive, and is therefore much more delicate. When the Bavarois is served after this last method it is some- times accompanied by stewed fruit or a MacMoine of fresh fruit ; though, in reality, these fruit adjuncts are better suited to cold puddings, which, in some points, are not unlike Bavarois.

Cold creams, served as entremets, belong to two very distinct classes : (i) Cooked Creams, which are, in short, but a variety of custard. (2) The Creams derived from natural, fresh cream, whipped and sugared, the generic type of which is Chantilly cream. Cooked Creams are prepared either in special little pots, in small silver or porcelain bowls, or in moulds. Those prepared in moulds are turned out when they are quite cold, and are called \" Cremes renversees \" to distinguish them from the first two kinds, which are always served in the utensil in which they have cooked. For all that, the term \" Creme renversee \" has grown somewhat obsolete, and the modern expression for this kind of custards is \" Creme moulde.\" Crkme au Caramel represents a perfect type of this class. The custards served in their cooking-receptacles are more delicate than the others, because their preparation does not demand such a large quantity of eggs ; but they are only served in the home, like English custard.

Set to poach in a bain-marie, in a moderate oven, keeping lids on the utensils. Not for one moment must the water in the bain-marie boil while the poaching is in progress ; for the air contained by the preparation would then become over-heated, and the result would be an infinity of small holes throughout the depth of the custard, which would greatly mar its appearance. As a matter of fact, the custard should poach, that is to say, coagulate, as the result of the surrounding water being kept at a constant temperature of 185° F. As soon as it is poached, let the custard cool. When it is poached in the utensils in which it is served, one egg and eight yolks per quart of milk will be found sufficient. The utensils should be carefully wiped and dished on a napkin. If the custard is to be turned out, carefully overturn the mould upon a dish, and pull it off a few minutes later. Moulded and potted custards admit of all the flavourings proper to entremets ; but those which suit them best are vanilla, almond milk, almond and filbert pralin, coffee, chocolate, etc. Unless used in the form of very concentrated essences, fruit flavours are less suited to them."

        "title": "JELLY WITH A GELATINE BASE",
        "instructions": "Dissolve one oz. of strong gelatine in a quart of water. Add one-half lb. of sugar, one-sixth oz. of coriander, and the zest and juice of half a lemon and of a whole orange ; boil, and then let the preparation stand for ten minutes away from the fire. Whisk one and a half egg-whites in a very clean saucepan, together with a port wine-glassful of white wine, and pour the cleared syrup, little by little, over the egg-whites, whisking briskly the while. Set the saucepan on the fire, and continue whisking until the boil is reached; then move the utensil to a corner of the stove, and keep the jelly only just simmering for one-quarter of an hour. At the end of that time the clarification is completed ; strain the jelly through a woollen bag, placed over a very clean bowl, and, if the jelly is turbid after the first time of straining, strain it again and again until it becomes quite clear. Let it almost cool before adding any flavour. The Flavouring. — Whether the jelly be prepared from calves' feet or from gelatine, the above preparation is naught else than a cohered syrup, to which the addition of some flavour lends the character of a jelly. The complementary ingredients for jellies are liqueurs, good wines, and the juice of fruit ; and the quantity of water prescribed should be so reduced as to allow for the ultimate addition of the liquid flavouring. Thus, every jelly of which the flavour is a liqueur ought to be prepared with only nine-tenths of a quart of water; and the remaining one-tenth of the measure is subsequently added in the form of Kirsch, Maraschino, Rum, or Anisette, etc. A jelly flavoured with a good wine, such as Champagne, Madeira, Sherry, Marsala, etc., should contain only seven-tenths of a quart of water and three-tenths of a quart of the selected wine. In the case of fruit jellies, the procedure differs in accordance with the kind of fruit used. For red-fruit jellies, prepared from strawberries, raspberries, red-currants, cherries, and cranberries, these fruits, which should be very ripe, are rubbed through a sieve, and combined with one- tenth to three-tenths of a quart of water per lb., according as to whether the fruit be more or less juicy. This done, filter the resulting juice, and add it to the jelly in the proportion of one part of the former to two parts of the latter. The jelly should therefore be twice as strong as for the previous preparation, in order that it may remain sufficiently consistent in spite of the added juice. When the fruit is too juicy, rub it through a sieve ; let the juice ferment for a few hours, and only filter the clear juice which results from the fermentation. Aqueous-fruit jellies, prepared from grapes, oranges, lemons, and tangerines, are made in the same way. The filtering of these fruit juices is easily done, and, except for the grapes, they need not be set to ferment. When these fruits are not quite ripe, their juices may be added to the jelly even before the clarification — a procedure which helps to modify their acidity. The apportionment of the fruit juices to the jelly is practically the same as that of the red-fruit juices. Stone-fruit, such as apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, etc., are often used as jelly garnishes, but seldom serve as the flavouring base of a jelly. Whenever they are treated in this way, they are first plunged in boiling water, that they may be peeled ; they are then poached and left to cool in the syrup which goes towards preparing the jelly. This jelly, after it has been clarified and three-parts cooled, should have a little Kirsch or Maraschino added to it, that its fruit flavour may be intensified."

The cold produced by the salted ice causes a frosted coat to form round the jelly, the effect of which is exceedingly pretty. But the moulds should be withdrawn from the ice as soon as the frosted coat is formed and the jelly is set ; for a longer sojourn in the cold would transform the jelly into an uneatable block of ice. N.B. — Modern methods have greatly simplified the dishing and serving of jellies. They are now dished in special silver bowls or deep dishes, and they are not, as a rule, moulded. The bottom of these utensils is sometimes decked with stewed fruit or macMoines of fruit which are covered with the jelly ; and, as the latter is served in the utensil itself, the quantity of gelatine may be reduced, and greater delicacy is the result."

        "instructions": "Make a vanilla-flavoured preparation of rice for entremets, using the quantities of milk and sugar already prescribed. When the rice is cooked, and somewhat cold, add to it four oz. of a salpicon of candied fruit and four tablespoonfuls of apricot jam, per one-half lb. of raw rice. Then combine with it an equal quantity of Kirsch-flavoured Bavarois preparation, or one pint of thick English custard and one pint of whipped cream. Let a layer of red-currant jelly set upon the bottom of a Bavarois mould ; then pour the above preparation into the latter and let the whole set, either in the cool or surrounded by ice. When about to serve, turn out on a napkin."

        "instructions": "Prepare a timbale of Savarjn paste in a Charlotte mould. When it is baked and cooled, remove the crumb from its inside leaving a thickness of half an inch on its bottom and sides ; smear it thinly with Kirsch-flavoured syrup, and return the timbale to the mould. Now garnish it with alternate layers of vanilla-flavoured, Bavarois preparation and wild strawberries, macerated in Kirsch. Let it set in the cool, or surround the mould with ice. Turn out the timbale first upon a plate ; overturn it on a dish, and upon it set a pyramid of vanilla-flavoured Chantilly cream. Stud the latter all over with small, very red strawberries, or garnish it with large half-strawberries. Surround the timbale with fine dice of strawberry jelly."

        "instructions": "Clothe an ornamented mould, fitted with a central tube, with a thick coat of very clear, Kirsch-flavoured jelly.

Turn it out, when about to serve, and surround it with very clear, chopped, Kirsch-flavoured jelly. 3 E 2 CHAPTER XX. ICES. Ices, with their accompanying \" pctits fours,\" bring the dinner to a close — at least as far as Cookery is concerned ; and, when they are well prepared and daintily dished, they are the consummation of all that is delicate and good. In no other department of the work has the culinary artist so freely indulged his fancy, or created such delectable kickshaws ; and, though Italy be the cradle of the ice-worker's art, though the Neapolitans have deservedly maintained their reputation as authorities in this matter, to French workmen, certainly, is due the credit of those innovations which have perfected this important branch of dietetic science."

        "title": "THE MAKING OF ICES",
        "instructions": "Whatever be the kind of ices required, they should always be prepared in advance ; for none of these preparations can be made reaiy at a moment's notice. Tliere are two distinct operations in the confection of ices : — (i) The making of the preparation. (2) The freezing and the moulding of the preparation. I shall begin by dealing with the second operation, which remains the same for all ices, and is the essential part of the procedure. To freeze an ice preparation is to surround it with broken ice, mixed with sodium chloride (sea-salt or freezing salt) and saltpetre. The action of these two salts upon the ice causes a considerable drop in the temperature, which speedily congeals any contiguous liquid. Subject to their nature, ices are either moulded and frozen directly in their moulds, like the light ices : iced Biscuits, iced Souffle, Puddings, Mottsses, Parfaits, Bombes, etc. ; or first frozen in a special utensil called a freezer, and then moulded and frozen afresh. Cream and syrup ices are prepared by the second method ; and this I shall now describe. The freezers, in which the freezing takes place, are gejierally wielded by hand, either directly or by means of some mechanism. They should be of pure tin, and fitted, at their base, on to a central"
