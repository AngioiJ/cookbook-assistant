        "instructions": "Trim the fillet; suppress the long muscle lying on its thicker side (Fr. chaine), and open the meat lengthwise from the same side. Withdraw the meat from the inside of the fillet so as to leave a wall of meat only one-half inch thick all round. Finely chop the withdrawn meat and combine with it, per lb., little by little, from four to five tablespoonfuls of cream and four oz. of fresh foie gras. Season with salt and pepper, rectify the consistence of the paste, and add thereto, per lb., two oz. of chopped truffles. Fill the hollow fillet with this forcemeat, thereby returning it to its original shape, and stud its top surface with pointed pieces of truffle one inch long by one-quarter inch wide, stuck into the meat aslant. In order to facilitate this operation, bore the meat, before the insertion of the pieces of truffles, by means of a small knife. Now cover the fillet with slices of bacon and string it laterally, leaving a space of one inch between each strand. Poele the meat carefully, and take care that the forcemeat inside be well, but not over-done. This may be ascertained by thrusting a braiding needle into the thickest part of the fillet, as soon as the meat seems resisting and elastic to the touch. If the needle withdraws clean, the fillet is ready. Now glaze it, after having cut away the string and removed the slices of bacon ; dish it, and surround it with the following garnish : — Small tartlet-crusts garnished by means of noodles with cream ; a slice of foie gras stamped out with a round cutter and tossed in butter, upon the noodles ; and a fine slice of truffle on the foie gras. Sauce to be sent to the table separately. — The reduced eoeZme-liquor of the fillet, cleared of all grease, and added to a Perigueux sauce."

For this purpose lard it, roast it (keeping it somewhat under- done towards the centre), and, when it is quite cold, trim, and coat it with half-melted jelly. Then set it either directly upon a dish or upon a cushion of bread or carved rice, which makes the dish more sightly when the garnish is added. Before setting the fillet on the dish or on the cushion of rice, it is well to cut a slice one-fifth inch thick from the whole of its base; leave this slice under the fillet when dishing; by this means, when the carving is proceeded with, each slice will be found to be neatly trimmed. Cold fillet of beef allows of every possible cold vegetable garnish. The vegetables should be cooked with the greatest care and be left to cool naturally. When they are quite cold, either cohere them by means of jelly, or set them round the fillet in neat heaps, taking care to alternate their shades, and coat them with almost melted aspic. Finally, between each heap of vegetables lay a little chopped and very clear aspic, and, round the whole, arrange a border consisting of bits of aspic (round, oval, square, lozenge-shaped, &c.) very regularly cut. I see no reason for devoting any further space to this subject. What has been said should, I think, suffice to show how varied and numerous are the possible ways of dishing cold fillet of beef, the minute details of which may, with advantage, be left to the ingenuity of the operator.

        "recipe_id": "1076",
        "title": "CHATEAUBRIAND, FILLET STEAK, TOURNEDOS",
        "instructions": "By fillet steaks are understood those pieces of meat cut laterally from the thickest part of the fillet of beef. They ought to be about one and one-half inches thick, and weigh from six to seven oz. Tournedos are half-fillets in re- spect of their weight, and might well be called the \"kernels \" of the fillet of beef. The usual thickness of a tournedos is about one and one-quarter inches, and they should be cut to a nice, round shape. With the object of preserving their shape, they may be tied round with string. Chateaubriand is also procured from the centre of fillet of beef, and its weight is often twice, thrice, and sometimes more than thrice as much as that of the ordinary fillet steaks. As a rule, especially when grilled, it constitutes a special roast for luncheons; when it is cooked in the saucepan, i.e., sauted, it is more often served as a Relev6. The same garnishes suit fillet, Chateaubriands, and tournedos, the only necessary modifications being in respect of size and arrangement, which should be subject to the size of the piece of meat. The garnishes detailed hereafter are for the tournedos, which supply the greatest number of the dishes prepared from the three different cuts of fillet. If a fillet steak be prepared after one of the following recipes, the garnish should be made a little stronger, and its constituents modified in the dishing, neither of which changes need in any way alter the formula. The same holds with regard to a Chateaubriand. Thus, for example, if it be required to prepare a fillet steak or a Chateau- briand, after the recipe \"Tournedos k I'Algerienne,\" the number of croquettes and tomatoes should be half as much again, and they should be arranged alternately round the meat, instead of the latter being placed on the croquettes, as in the case of the tournedos. If the fillets are to be treated \"k I'Alsacienne,\" after the recipe for tournedos, the sauerkraut should be dished in a tim- bale instead of in tartlet-crusts, &c. All that is needed, therefore, is a change in the method of arrangement, and this can be decided upon at a glance, without necessarily interfering with the principle of the recipe. It should be borne in mind that nearly all the garnishes given under fillet of beef, served whole, may be applied to Chateaubriands, fillet steak, and tournedos, provided they be made in proportion to the size of the different pieces. I see no need, therefore, to repeat these vegetable recipes in so far as they relate to the various cuts of fillet of beef. It is only necessary to add that for the fillet of beef, as well as for tournedos, noisettes, &c., a large number of plain vegetable garnishes may be used, the details of which I prefer to omit for fear of unduly lengthening this work. Whole fillets, fillet steak, and tournedos may thus be served with garnishes of braised celery, tuberous fennel, cardoons with gravy, chow-chow and endives, braised lettuce, various purees, &c., and, generally, with all the vegetable preparations given in Chapter XVII. Important Remarks relative to the Sauces suited to Entries of Butcher's Meat, Garnished with Vegetables The derivative sauces of the Espagnole are not, as a rule, suited to entrees garnished with vegetables. Thickened gravy is better. The finest adjunct, however, is meat-glaze, which should receive an addition of four oz. of butter per pint, and should be slightly acidulated by means of a few drops of lemon juice. This glaze ought to be so light as not to impaste the vegetables. Such vegetables as asparagus-heads, peas, French beans, macedoines, &c., have a disintegrating action upon the sauces, and this is owing either to their natural moisture or to their leason. As a result of this action the preparation has an un- sightly appearance when served upon the diner's plate. With Chateaubriand sauce (No. 71) or buttered meat-glaze this objection does not obtain, seeing that this sauce does not decompose, but combines admirably with the garnish, and lends the latter a certain noticeable mellowness. I therefore emphasise this point, viz., that the derivative sauces of the Espagnole and tomato sauces should be exclusively used with such preparations garnished with truffles, cock's combs and kidneys, quenelles and mushrooms, as \"la Financiere,\" \"la Godard,\" &c.

As a rule, when sirloin of beef is braised, it is cut laterally into pieces weighing from six to seven lbs. If it is to be roasted, it is best to keep it whole. When served as a releve, it is braised or roasted, and is kept underdone if so desired. Unless it be of excellent quality, however, braised sirloin generally turns out to be dry. All garnishes given for \"Filet de Boeuf \" may be served with sirloin; but, as a rule, the bulkiest, such as the \" Riche- lieu,\" the \" Proven9ale,\" the \" Godard,\" &c., are selected. The accompanying sauce is that indicated for the above garnishes. 1 142— PORTERHOUSE-STEAK (Grill) Porterhouse-steak is a slice from the sirloin of beef, which may be more or less thick. It is cleared of the flank and of the bones of the chine, and it is always grilled. It may be served with any of the various garnishes and sauces suited to grills; but it is more often served plain. 1 143— UPPER FILLET AND RIBS OF BEEF (Releve) The upper fillet is that part of beef which lies between the top of the haunch and the floating ribs, alongside of the chine. It may be treated like the fillet, and all the garnishes suited to the latter may also be applied here. If the piece is to be braised, it should be completely boned ; if intended for roasting, it is best to retain the bones. In the latter case, the large ligament should be cut at various points with the view of preventing distortion, while the bones con- stituting the spinous process should be broken close to the point where they join the body of the vertebrae, that they may be easily removed when the meat is being carved. The upper fillet, especially when it is of good quality, is best roasted. Ribs of beef may likewise be braised or roasted. In either case, the meat should be properly trimmed and cleared of all the bones of the spinous process. This piece should only be used after having been well hung, in order that it may be as tender as possible. 1 144— GRILLED SIRLOIN STEAKS AND RIBS OF BEEF The sirloin steak may be cut either from the upper fillet or the ribs of beef, i.e., between two rib-bones. In order that its cooking may be regular, it should not weigh more than from two to three lbs. Ribs of beef may also be grilled, provided they be sufficiently tender. They may be braised, too, and in this case they are served with any of the various garnishes given under Fillet of Beef. 1 145— PIECE DE BCEUF BRAISeE (Releve) The piece of beef called rump is the one preferred for boiling and braiding. Whatever be the use for which the meat is in- tended, the weight of the pieces should not be more than six or eight lbs. at the most, and they should be cut in the length rather than in the thickness, that the cooking process may be facilitated. All the garnishes of braised sirloin of beef are suited to braised pieces of beef. Boiled beef is generally accompanied by the vegetables used in its cooking-process, by purees, green or dry vegetables, pastes, macaroni, &c., &c."

        "title": "PIECE DE B(EUF A LA BOURQUIGNONNE",
        "instructions": "Lard the piece of beef, and marinade it for three hours in brandy and red wine. Braise it after the manner described under No. 247 ; moisten first with the wine of the marinade, and, when the latter is reduced, with some veal gravy and one- half pint of Espagnole sauce per quart of liquid, taking care that the whole moistening reaches the top of the piece of meat. Add a faggot and some mushroom parings; set to boil, and cook gently in the oven. When the meat is two-thirds cooked, transfer it to another saucepan, and surround it with mushrooms cut into two or four, according to their size, and tossed in butter; breast of bacon, cut into dice, blanched and tossed in butter, and some small onions half-glazed with butter. Strain the sauce through a sieve over the piece of beef and its garnish, and complete the cooking gently. A few minutes before serving, put the meat on a dish and glaze it in the oven. Transfer the meat to the dish intended for the table; quickly reduce the sauce if necessary, and pour it over the piece of beef and the garnish. 1 147— PifiCE DE B(EUF A LA CUILLER Select a very square or oval piece of beef, and bear in mind, in selecting it, that it will have to be fashioned to the shape of a case when it has been cooked. String it, and braise it after the manner described under No. 247, almost entirely covering it with moistening liquor. Set it to cook gently; withdraw the piece when the meat is still somewhat firm, and let it cool under slight pressure. This done, cut out the meat from the inside; leave a thick- ness of about half-inch round the sides and on the bottom, and the piece thus emptied should constitute a square or oval case, in accordance with the shape originally adopted. Coat the outside of the whole piece with a mixture of beaten eggs and fine bread-crumbs, combined with Parmesan ; sprinkle melted butter over it with a brush, and put the case into a sufficiently hot oven to allow of a crust forming round it. Meanwhile chop up the meat extracted from the inside of the piece ; add thereto a little salted tongue, some braised slices of sweet-bread, and mushrooms ; put the whole into a sautepan with an Italian or a half-glaze sauce, according to the require- ments, and heat this garnish. N.B. — This preparation was quite common in old-fashioned cookery, but though it is still served occasionally, it is now looked upon more as a curiosity than anything else. As a curiosity, therefore, I chose to include it among these recipes; but it does not follow from this that I in any way recommend it. 1 148— PIECE DE B(EUF A LA FLAMANDE Lard the piece of beef, and braise it as explained under No. 247. Meanwhile prepare the following garnish : — (i) Cut a nice firm cabbage into four, remove the heart, and parboil it for seven or eight minutes. Drain it; cool it; divide up the quarters, leaf by leaf, so as to remove the hard ribs, and season with salt and pepper. Mould them to the shape of balls by pressing them in the corner of a towel into balls weighing about three oz. each, or simply put them into a saucepan with a quartered carrot, an onion stuck with a clove, a faggot, six oz. of blanched breast of pork, and a little raw sausage with garlic, which latter must be withdrawn after cooking has gone on for one and one-half hours. Moisten the cabbage with just sufficient consomme to cover it; add a few tablespoonfuls of good stock-fat; set to boil, and cook gently in the oven for one and one-half hours. (2) Cut the required quantity of carrots and turnips to the shape of olives ; cook them in consomme, and reduce the latter for the purpose of glazing. (3) Prepare some potatoes d I'anglaise. Set the piece of beef on a dish large enough to allow of the former being surrounded with the moulded or plainly-heaped cabbages, the glazed carrots arid turnips, and the potatoes d I'anglaise. The last two vegetables should be set in alternate heaps with the cabbages and the bacon (cut into small rectangles) and the sausage (cut into roundels) should be distributed all round. Serve separately the gravy of the piece of beef, cleared of all grease, reduced to a half-glaze and strained. 1 149— PIECE DE BCEUF A LA MODE CHAUDE Lard the piece of beef, which should not, if possible, weigh more than from four to five lbs. The strips of bacon used for larding ought to have been prepared fifteen or twenty minutes in advance, marinaded in a few tablespoonfuls of brandy, and sprinkled with parsley just before being used. Rub the piece with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and put it into a basin with one bottle of red wine and one-fifth pint of brandy, and set it to marinade for four or five hours, taking care to turn it over from time to time. Then set it to braise after the manner described under No. 247 ; add its marinade to the moistening, and surround it with three small, boned, blanched, and strung calf's feet. When the cooking is three-quarters done, transfer the piece of beef to another saucepan, and surround it with the following garnish : — 1. About one-quarter lb. of carrots turned to the shape of elongated olives, and already two-thirds cooked. 2. Small onions coloured in two-thirds lb. of butter, 3. The calf's feet cut into small, square, or rectangular pieces. Strain the braising-Iiquor over the whole, and complete the cooking gently. When about to serve, either glaze the piece of beef, or dish it plain ; coat it lightly with sauce, and send what remains of the latter, with the garnish, in a timbale. I ISO— PIECE DE BCEUF A LA MODE FROIDE Boeuf k la mode is very rarely prepared specially for cold dishing, the remains of a fine piece being generally used for that purpose. The piece of meat must first be well trimmed. If the quantity of sauce do not seem enough, or if the sauce itself seem too stiff, add a third of its volume of aspic jelly to it. For moulding, take a terrine a pate, a mould, or other utensil capable of holding the piece of meat, its garnish, and its sauce. Deck the bottom of the utensil in any suitable way with the carrots and the onions, and surround the piece with what remains of the latter and the dice of calf's foot, Add the sauce, combined with the jelly, after having passed it through a strainer, and put the whole in the cool for a few hours. Turn out just before serving, and surround with very light, chopped jelly. 1 151— PIECE DE BCEUF A LA NOAILLES Lard the piece of beef, and marinade it in brandy and red wine. This done, dry it thoroughly, and brown it evenly in butter all over ; moisten it with its marinade and an equal quantity of veal gravy, and set to cook gently. When the meat is half-cooked, surround it with two lbs. of minced onions, tossed in butter, and three oz. of rice. Complete the cooking of the piece with onions and rice. Now withdraw the piece of beef, and quickly rub the onions and the rice through tammy. Reduce this Soubise with rice for a few moments. Neatly trim the piece of beef; cut it into even slices; recon- struct it on a dish, and between each slice pour a tablespoonful of Soubise puree. Cover the reconstructed piece of beef with the remainder of the Soubise; sprinkle the surface with two tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs fried in butter, and some melted butter, and put the whole in the oven, that the gratin may form speedily."

        "instructions": "RUMPSTEAK AND BEEFSTEAK. The rump is that portion of the sirloin of beef which touches the top of the haunch. It may be braised, but it is more often grilled in slices from one inch to one and one-half inches thick, which are called \" rumpsteaks.\" With reference to this subject, it is as well to point out that the term \" Beefsteak,\" so hackneyed in France, is scarcely used in England, owing to its want of precision. In France, beefsteak is either a cut from the fillet, the upper- fillet, or the rump, according to the standing of the catering- house which supplies it. But the nature of the piece cannot very well be mistaken, inasmuch as the term beefsteak, which designates it, is generally followed by other French words which reveal its origin, whereas in England the term \"Beefsteak\" does not convey any particular meaning. Rumpsteak is either grilled or sauted, but whatever be the method of cooking it, it is generally served plain. All garnishes suited to fillets, however, may be served with it, as also the various butters and sauces generally used with grills."

When about to use them, put them to soak in cold water for a few hours, and then cook them plainly in water for three hours. This done, withdraw them from their cooking-liquor; skin them; cover them with buttered paper, and let them cool. The object of the paper is to keep off the air, the tendency of which is to blacken the surface of the meat.

Sew up the tail, cover it with a piece of linen after the manner of a galantine, and cook it gently for three hours in a very light stock with vegetables as for boiled beef. At the end of the three hours take it out of the linen ; put it into a sautepan, the bottom of which should be garnished as for a braising ; add a little of the cooking-liquor of the tail, and complete the cooking, basting often the while. Take care to baste more frequently towards the close of the operation with the view of properly glazing the meat. When about to serve, dish it, after having removed all string, and lightly coat the bottom of the dish with a sauce consisting of the cooking-liquor, reduced and thickened with arrow-root.

To the cooking-liquor is added a copious garnish of carrots and turnips. These are served with the meat, together with a sauceboat of cooking-liquor and a suet dumpling, prepared as follows : — 1 166— SUET DUMPLING Finely chop up some suet; add to it an equal quantity of flour and about one-quarter oz. of salt per lb. of suet and flour. Moisten with just enough water to make a thick paste of about the same consistence as brioche-paste. Cut this paste into portions weighing about one oz., and roll them into small balls. Put the latter in a sautepan containing some boiling beef cooking-liquor, which need not have been cleared of grease, and let them poach for one and one-half hours. Now drain the dumplings, and arrange them around the meat with the garnish of carrots and turnips, as explained above. 1 167— COLD SALT BEEF Salt beef, served cold, constitutes an excellent sideboard dish for luncheons. It need only be neatly trimmed all round, care being taken to preserve all the fat so highly esteemed by some. Indeed, a piece of cold salt fat is sometimes added to that already existing around and in the meat, in which case the extra quantity is fixed to the beef by means of a hatelet. 1 168— PRESSED BEEF Salt beef also serves in the preparation of \" Pressed Beef,\" but, for this purpose, the breast is generally used. After having thoroughly cooked the salted breast of beef in accordance with the procedure indicated for salt beef, cut it into large pieces of the same size as the moulds into which the meat is going to be pressed. Lay the pieces of beef one on top of another in a square or rectangular mould, and cover with a thick board, cut flush with the inside edge of the mould. Now apply pressure, either by means of a strong press or heavy weight, and leave the beef to cool under the applied pressure. When the meat is quite cold, turn it out; trim it carefully on all sides, and glaze it, i.e., cover it entirely with a coating of rather firm, clarified gelatine, brought by means of carmine and caramel to a nice red-brown colour. 1 1 69— STEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING Cut three lbs. of very lean beef into slices one-third inch thick. Season these slices with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and add a little chopped onion and parsley. Take a pudding-basin ; line it with a firm layer of suet-dough (No. 1166), and garnish the bottom and sides of the basin with the slices of beef. In the middle put one lb. of kidney of beef, of veal, or of mutton, cut up as for tossing, and seasoned like the steaks. Moisten with just sufficient water to cover. Now close up the basin with a layer of the same paste as that used in lining, pinching it with the latter, all round, that it may adhere thoroughly. In order to effect this with greater c c 2 certainty, the respective edges of the two layers of paste may be moistened. This done, cover the basin with a buttered and dredged napkin, fastened on by means of string tied round just beneath the Hp of the utensil. Cook for five hours, either in boiling water or in steam, and, after having removed the napkin, serve the pudding as it stands. 1 1 70— STEAK PUDDING Make some rather stiff paste with two lbs. of flour, one and one-quarter lbs. of the chopped fat of kidney of beef, a pinch of salt, and one-quarter pint of water. With the rolling-pin, roll out this paste to a round layer one-quarter inch thick, and put it into a buttered dome-mould or pudding-basin. Cut the lean beef into pieces, and season them, exactly as for steak and kidney pudding. Fill up the basin with the pieces arranged in layers; moisten with just enough water to cover, and close up the basin with a layer of the same paste as that used for its lining. Carefully join the edges of the two layers of paste, assisting the operation with a little moisture applied by means of a brush ; swathe the basin in a buttered pudding-cloth, and fasten the latter firmly with string. Put the pudding in a saucepan of boiling water or a steamer, and leave it to cook for three hours if the beef has been cut from the fillet, and for four hours if cut from any other piece. At the end of the required time take the pudding out of the saucepan and remove the cloth. Dish on a folded napkin. 1 171— STEAK AND OYSTER PUDDING Proceed exactly as for steak and kidney pudding, but take only two lbs. of beef, and replace the odd pound by forty fine oysters."

        "instructions": "Cut the meat into small cubes. Also cut into dice the same weight of potatoes as of meat. Season these potatoes and toss them in butter. This done, put half their quantity into a saucepan with the meat dice, and cohere the whole with a few tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce and reduced veal gravy. Heat without allowing to boil; dish in a hot timbale; distribute the remainder of the potatoes, which should be crisply fried, over the hash, and sprinkle with a pinch of freshly-chopped parsley. 1 179— HACHIS DE BCEUF A PARMENTIER Bake some fine potatoes in the oven. The moment they are done, slice off a piece of their baked shell, and remove the pulp from their insides by means of a spoon handle. Crush this pulp with a fork, and toss it in butter as for \" pommes de terre Macaire.\" Then add to it as much beef in dice as there is pulp; two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion cooked in butter per lb. of the preparation; a pinch of chopped parsley, and a few drops of vinegar. Now toss the whole together for a few minutes, and then fill the empty potato shells with the preparation. Sprinkle with Lyonnaise sauce rubbed through tammy, and add as much of it as the hash will absorb. Replace the portion of shell cut off at the first, that the potatoes may seem untouched ; arrange them on a dish, and put the latter in the oven for ten minutes. When about to serve, dish the stuffed potatoes on a napkin. 1 180— TRIPES A LA MODE DE CAEN In the preparation of this culinary speciality of Normandy, a very common mistake is often made; to wit, that of using calves' feet instead of those of the ox, an innovation to which there are many objections. In the first place, the gravy of the tripe cannot absorb so much gelatine, and is indifferently thickened in consequence; secondly, since calves' feet are much more tender than those of the ox, the former get boiled to shreds before the cooking of the tripe has been properly effected. This supposed improve- ment on the old method is thus seen to actually run counter to the end in view; but means there are, nevertheless, whereby those who insist upon the use of calves' feet may be satisfied. It is only necessary to braise a number of calves' feet before- hand, the number being in proportion to the quantity of tripe, and to add these to the latter a quarter of an hour before serving. Another mistake which obtains somewhat widely in respect of this dish is the serving of it in a silver utensil — a method quite as unreasonable as that of serving a Chaudfroid in an earthenware dish. By virtue of its simplicity, tripe should be served in either sandstone or special earthenware stewpans, wherein heat is best retained ; and the operator should rather direct his attention to the serving of tripe as hot as possible, than to this or that fanciful method of dishing, which really has no raison d'etre in this case. The Preparation of Trife. — Under the head of \" beef tripe \" are understood : (i) The feet; (2) tripe proper, which comprises the Paunch, the Honey-comb Bag, the Manyplies, and the Reed. First soak the tripe in cold water for some considerable time ; then cut it into squares of two inches side. For the seasoning and flavouring of tripe, complete in all its parts, take : (Seasoning) one-quarter oz. of salt and a pinch of pepper per lb.; (flavouring) four lbs. of onions stuck with four cloves; three lbs. of carrots; one faggot, comprising two lbs. of leeks, one-third lb. of parsley stalks, a sprig of thyme, and a bay leaf. Moisten with two quarts of good cider (not likely to turn black while cooking, otherwise use water) ; one-half pint of brandy or liqueur-cider. The quantity of the moistening-liquor largely depends upon the shape of the utensil ; a little less will be needed in the case of a narrow one, and a little more in the case of a wide one. In any case, however, the tripe should be just covered. Treatment and Cooking-process. — Take a stewpan or brais- ing-pan, just large enough to hold the tripe and the garnish. On the bottom of this lay carrots, onions, seasoning, and the four ox feet, boned and cut into fair-sized pieces. Add the tripe, placing the faggot in its midst; upon the tripe lay the bones of the feet, broken lengthwise ; some slices of beef-fat, well soaked in cold water; and, finally, the moistening. Cover the whole with a kind of galette of paste, consisting of flour mixed with hot water and kept somewhat stiff, and fix the paste well on to the edges of the utensil. Place in the oven, and, when about two hours have elapsed and the paste is well baked, close the utensil with its own cover. In a regular and moderate oven, allow about ten hours for the cooking. The Dishing and Serving. — After taking the tripe out of the oven, remove the cover of paste, the bones, the fat, the carrots, the onions, and the faggot, and by means of a slice withdraw the pieces of tripe and set them in the special earthen- ware bowls, taking care to distribute the pieces, coming from different portions of tripe, in such wise as to meet the demands or fancies of the various consumers. When the tripe has been transferred to the bowls, clear the gravy of ail grease, and dole it out evenly among the number of receptacles. It is best, now, to put the latter in a bain- marie, for they must only be served quite hot, on chafers or otherwise. N.B. — (i) To make the dish to perfection, the tripe should be put into special earthenware pots (wherein the heat is more effectively concentrated), and cooked in a baker's or pastry- cook's oven. I dealt with the alternative of cooking tripe in a stewpan in order to make provision for those who can avail themselves of neither special pots nor a baker's oven. (2) The measures I prescribe, namely, those of first laying the slices of beef-fat upon the tripe, and then covering the whole with a lid of paste, are intended to stop a too rapid evaporation of the liquid — a contingency that must be guarded against, more particularly in a kitchen oven — and to preserve the whiteness of the tripe. The cover of paste would be quite useless if a baker's oven were available, for the latter not only ensures perfectly regular heat, but also wanes regularly. 2. VEAL. With the exception of veal sweetbreads, it cannot be denied that this meat is considerably less popular in England than abroad, nor does it ever seem to appear on important menus in this country. Of course, and the fact must not be lost sight of, English veal is admittedly inferior in quality — badly fattened, and mostly red, soft, and dry. Probably, therefore, its unpopularity may be the indirect cause of its poor quality; for it is incon- ceivable that a country so famous for cattle-rearing as England undoubtedly is could not produce veal equal in quality to its beef, mutton, and pork, if rearers thought it worth their while to perfect that special branch of their business. Be this as it may, almost all the best veal consumed in England comes from the Continent, principally from France, Belgium, and Holland; and, in this respect, I not only refer to the larger joints, but to those odd parts such as the head, the liver, the sweetbreads, &c., the continental quality of which is likewise very superior to that of the English produce."

        "instructions": "Saddle of veal is the only Releve of this meat which is sometimes allowed to appear on an important menu, and it is, in fact, a splendid and succulent joint. It may be roasted, but I should urge the adoption of the braising treatment, not only as a precaution against dryness, but because of the fine stock yielded by the operation. Whatever be the method of cooking, trim the saddle on one side, flush with the bones of the pelvis, and up to the first ribs on the other side. Then cut out the kidneys, leaving a thick layer of fat on the under fillets or \"filets mignons \" ; pare the flank on either side, in such wise that what is left of it, when drawn under the saddle on either side, may just cover the fillets above referred to. This flank should only be drawn over the fillets after the inside of the joint has been salted; then cover the top surface of the joint with slices of bacon, and tie round with string, five or six times, that the bacon and the flank may not shift. When the saddle is intended for only a small number of people, half of it may be used at a time; that is to say, one fillet, in which case the joint may be cut in two, lengthwise. The procedure for braising this piece is in pursuance of the directions given under \" The Braising of White Meats \" (No. 248). The process of braising, whether it be in respect of the saddle or other veal Relev6s, such as the cushion, the loin, the neck, &c., demands particular care, must be accompanied by frequent basting, and should always be carried on with short moistening."

Set it on a long dish, and, at each end of the latter, place a chartreuse of vegetables. Round the joint put a few tablespoonfuls of the braising- liquor, cleared of all grease, reduced, and well-strained; and serve what remains in a sauceboat. Chartreuses of Vegetables. — Take two dome- or Charlotte- moulds, capable of holding two-thirds of a quart. Butter them liberally ; line them with buttered paper, and on the latter, over the bottom and sides of the utensil, lay carrots, turnips, peas, and French beans; each of which vegetables should be cooked in a way suited to its nature. This operation, which is some- what finicking, may either be effected on the plan of a draught- board, or the different vegetables may be superposed in alter- nate rows of varying colours. When the moulds are garnished in this way, spread thereon, over the vegetables, a layer of forcemeat softened with beaten white of egg; the object of this measure is to keep the vegetable decoration in position, and this is effected by the poaching of the forcemeat before the chartreuse is filled with its garnish. This done, fill the moulds to within one-third inch of their brims with a Macedoine of vegetables cohered by means of stiff Bdchamel and cream, and cover with a layer of forcemeat. Set these chartreuses to poach thirty-five minutes before serving, and take care to let them rest for five minutes before unmoulding them on either side of the saddle. 1 183— SELLE DE VEAU A LA METTERNICH Braise the saddle, and, when it is ready, put it on a dish. Now draw a line within one-half inch of its extreme edge on either side and end, pressing the point of a small knife along the meat in so doing. Proceed in the same way on either side of the chine, and remove the fillets from the joint, severing them from the bone with care. Cut the fillets into regular collops, keeping the knife some- what at a slant. In the double cavity left by the fillets spread a few table- spoonfuls of Bechamel with paprika; return the colloped fillets to their respective places in the joint, reconstructing them in such wise as to malie them appear untouched; and between the collops pour one-half tablespoonful of B6chamel and lay two slices of truffle. This done, cover the whole surface of the joint with Bechamel sauce with paprika, and set to glaze quickly at the salamander. Now, with a large slice, carefully transfer the saddle to a dish.

Decorate it with fine, regular, jelly dice ; but its usual and essential adjunct is its own braising-liquor, cooked, cleared of grease poured carefully away, and served in a sauceboat without having been either clarified or cleared. All the pieces of veal given as relev6s, the cushion, the loin, the fillet, and the fricahdeau, may be served cold like the saddle, and are generally much appreciated, more particularly in summer. 1 193— LOIN OF VEAL ii94~NECK OF VEAL 1 195— SHORT LOIN OF VEAL 1 196— CHUMP OF VEAL OR QUASI 1 197— CUSHION OF VEAL (Releves) I have grouped these various Releves together owing to the identicalness of their garnishes. The directions I give below for cushion of veal are, with a very few exceptions which I shall point out, applicable to all other large veal joints. In the circumstances, therefore, it would be quite unnecessary to repeat the recipe in each case. Loin of Veal is that piece which corresponds with the sirloin in beef. It extends from the floating ribs to the extreme end of the haunch, the latter being cut flush with the pelvic bone at its junction with the femur, and following the direction of the former bone. The loin thus consists of two distinct parts : — (i) the caudal region (called the chump end; Fr. quasi), which comprises the bones of the pelvis and the haunch, up to the level of the latter, and is one of the best pieces of veal for braising; and (2) the region extending from the haunch to the floating ribs, comprising the fillet and the upper fillet. This last portion also constitutes a choice joint, to which the kidneys are generally left attached, after all their superfluous fat has been removed. Neck or Best End of Veal consists of the first eight or nine ribs, cut two inches above the kernel of meat. The ends of the rib-bones are cleared of meat to a height of about two-thirds inch, and the naked bone is then called the \" handle \" of the cutlet, which ultimately holds the ornamental frill of paper. The vertebrae are then suppressed, so that the bones of the ribs alone remain ; the yellow ligament is cut away ; and the bared parts are covered with slices of bacon, tied on by means of string. Cushion of Veal consists of an enormous muscle, which represents almost half of the haunch and all the inside part of it, from the pelvis to its junction with the tibia. A certain quantity of white fat will always be found to lie over the cushion, and it should be carefully reserved. If the cushion is to be larded, a procedure which I do not advise, it should be done on the bared part adjoining the fat- covered region. The various pieces of veal enumerated above may be roasted, but, as in the case of the saddle, I prefer braising, owing to the greater succulence of the dish resulting from this process, and its accompanying gravy, which has an incomparable flavour. (See Braising of White Meats, No. 248.) 1 198— ADJUNCTS TO CUSHION OF VEAL Cushion of veal, like the other large pieces of veal, admits of an almost unlimited number of vegetable garnishes, simple or compound, as also garnishes of various pastes. From among these garnishes the following may be quoted, viz. : — Bouquetiere, Bourgeoise, Chartreuse, Choisy, Chicoree, Cardoons, Clamart, Braised Celery, Japanese Artichokes, Chow-chow, Endives, Spinach, Braised Lettuce, k la Vichy, k la Nemours, &c. ; Jardiniere, Macedoine, Renaissance, &c. Among the paste garnishes : — Noodles, Macaroni, Spa- ghetti, variously prepared ; various Gnocchi, &c. And, in addition to all these, the garnishes already given under Beef Releves, which need not be repeated here. I shall, therefore, give only three recipes which are proper to cushion of veal ; though even these should be regarded as mere curiosities, seeing that, far from recommending them, I consider them rather as gastronomical mistakes. But some provision must be made for outlandish tastes, and, for this reason alone, I include the following recipes."

Take care to leave the same thickness of meat on the sides as on the bottom, that is to say, about one-half inch. The cushion of veal, thus emptied, should have the appearance of a round or oval case. If the meat withdraAvn from the centre of the cushion is to serve for the garnish, or is to be used sliced to surround the case, cut it from out the whole in the largest possible pieces, in order that slices may easily be cut therefrom. The inside of the emptied cushion of veal is then garnished according to fancy; the top of the piece that was cut off at the start is returned to its place, with the view of giving the piece an untouched appearance, and the whole is put in the oven for a few minutes that it may be hot for serving.

Then, blanch it for a good half-hour; cool it in cold water ; drain it, and rub it with a piece of lemon to avoid its blackening. If it is to be cooked whole, as sometimes happens, wrap it in a napkin, that it maybe easily handled ; if not, cut it into pieces. In either case, plunge it immediately into a boiling blanc (No. 167). With a view of keeping the calf's head from contact with the air, which would blacken it, cover it with a napkin, or cover the liquid with chopped suet. A layer of chopped suet is the best possible means of keeping the air from the calf's head. Whatever be the method of serving calf's head, it is the rule to send slices of tongue and collops of brain to the table with it. The tongue may be cooked simultaneously with the head, and the brain is poached as described under No. 1289."

Serve separately, on a hors-d'oeuvre dish, without mixing them, capers, chopped onion and parsley.

Their weight varies from three to four oz., and they should always be cleared of all connective tissue. They may be fashioned to the shape of ovals, or curve-based triangles, and they should be more or less flattened, according to their use. Thus, when they are to be plainly tossed, to be afterwards served with a sauced garnish or with a sauce, they are simply beaten in order to break the fibres of the meat, without flattening the latter too much; but if, on the contrary, they are to be treated d I'anglaise, they should be beaten very thin with the moistened beater. In either case, they should be cooked somewhat quickly in clarified butter; for, if their cooking lag at all, their meat hardens. All the garnishes of veal cutlets, and a large number of those of the cushion, may be served with the collops. These garnishes may be set on the same dish with the collops when the latter are plainly tossed ; but, in the case of collops treated a I'anglaise, the garnish or sauce which accompanies them should be served separately, lest its moisture soften the crisp coating of the collops."

They are really small fricandeaux, the braising of which is a comparatively lengthy operation ; for their cooking must be the same as that of the fricandeaux, and needs quite as much atten- tion. In order that the grenadins be not too dry, they should be frequently basted with their braising-liquor. When they are cooked, glaze them rapidly, and dish them with one of the garnishes given for the cushion of veal. 12 17— QRENADINS FROIDS EN BELLEVUE This dish may be prepared in several more or less compli- cated ways ; here is a simple way : — Take as many shell-shaped hors-d'oeuvre dishes as there are grenadins. Let a thin coat of jelly set on the bottom of each, and set thereon a slight decoration composed of bits of carrot, turnip, peas, French beans in lozenge-form, &c. Put a gren- adin, larded side undermost (i.e., upside down) into each hors- d'oeuvre dish ; add enough melted aspic jelly to reach half-way up the thickness of the grenadin. When this jelly has set, lay on it, all round the grenadin, a border consisting of carrots, turnips, French beans and peas. Sprinkle these vegetables with a few drops of jelly, so as to fix them, and keep them from floating, and then fill up the hors-d'ceuvre dishes with jelly. When about to serve, dip the hors-d'oeuvre dishes into hot water; turn out the grenadins on a very cold dish, and arrange them on it to form a crown.

        "instructions": "Veal sweetbreads may be looked upon as one of the greatest delicacies in butchers' meats, and may be served at any dinner, however sumptuous. Select them very white, entirely free of blood stains, and leave them to soak in fresh water, which should be frequently changed, for as long as possible ; or, better still, place them under a running tap. To blanch them (an operation the purpose of which is to harden the surface) put them in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover them completely, and bring to the boil gently. Let them boil for ten minutes ; withdraw them and plunge them into a basin of fresh water. When the sweetbreads are cold, trim them ; that is to say, cut away all cartilaginous and connective tissue; lay them between two pieces of linen, and put them under a light weight for two hours. Now lard them with fine bacon, tongue or truffle, subject to the way in which they are to be served. They may also be studded with either tongue or truffles, or they may be left unlarded and unstudded, and plainly braised, just as they are. Certain it is, that neither studding nor larding enhances in any way whatsoever their quality or sightliness. Veal sweetbread consists of two parts, as unequal in quality as in shape. They are: the \"kernel\" or heart sweetbread, which is the round and most delicate part, and the \" throat,\" or throat sweetbread, which is the elongated part, and not of such fine quality as the former. In a well-ordered dinner, heart sweetbreads only should be used, as far as possible. There are three ways of cooking sweetbreads, viz. : — Braising (No. 248), poaching (No. 249), and grilling (No. 259). In the following recipes, therefore, the reader will kindly refer to the directions given under one of the numbers just mentioned, according as to whether the dish is to be a braising, a poaching, or a grill."

When they are sauted, the cutlets should be cooked in clari- fied butter, over a somewhat fierce fire and in a utensil large enough to hold them without crowding. This done, dish them ; pour away the butter in which they have been cooked; swill the saucepan, i.e., dissolve the concen- trated gravy adhering to the sides and bottom of it with a liquid in keeping with the garnish ; either mushroom cooking-liquor, white or red wine, or Madeira, etc. ; and add this swilling- liquor, reduced, to the accompanying sauce. The latter is generally a buttered half-glaze, but the best adjunct to veal cutlets is a pale meat glaze, moderately buttered. All vegetable and paste garnishes, given under Cushion of Veal, suit veal cutlets. I must therefore beg the reader to refer to those recipes, as circumstances may dictate ; and restrict myself to a few formulae which, in my opinion, are suited more particularly to veal cutlets."

MUTTON, GRASS LAMB AND HOUSE LAMB Releves and Entrees. From the culinary standpoint, the ovine species supplies three kinds of meat, viz : — Mutton — properly so-called when the meat is derived from the adult animal. Lamb — the young, weaned sheep, not yet fully grown, the meat of which is the more highly esteemed the younger the animal is. House Lamb — the sheep's unweaned young that has not yet grazed. The \" Pauillac \" Iamb, which is imported from France, is the most excellent example of the last kind. Good house lambs are also killed in England ; they are quite equal to Pauillac lamb, but their season is short. As regards ordinary English mutton and lamb, however, the delicacy and quality of these meats are unrivalled. But for its greater delicacy and tenderness, grass lamb, which corresponds v.'ith what the French call \" agneau de pr6- sale \" is scarcely distinguishable from mutton. The recipes suited to it are the same as those given for mutton ; and all that is necessary is to allow for differences of quality in calculating the time of cooking. House lamb, the white flesh of which is quite different, admits of some of the mutton recipes; but it is generally pre- pared after special formulfe, the details of which I shall give hereafter. When served roasted, hot or cold, mutton and grass and house lamb are always accompanied by mint sauce, the recipe for which I gave under No. 136. In view of the similarity of their preparations, and in order to avoid finicking repetitions, I have refrained from giving sepa- rate recipes for lamb and mutton respectively. The reader will therefore bear in mind that the formute relating to mutton also apply to grass lamb."

        "title": "NECK OF MUTTON (Relev6s)",
        "instructions": "Saddle of mutton is that part of the sheep which reaches from the bone of the haunch to the floating ribs. Baron of mutton comprises the saddle and the two legs, i.e., a pair of hind-quarters. Double consists of the two unseparated legs, minus the saddle. The Baron and the Double are almost always cuts of lamb. The fillet is one half of the saddle, when the latter is cut into two, lengthwise ; that is to say, divided down the middle in suchwise as to bisect the spinal column. These fillets are some- times boned, rolled over with the kernel of meat in the centre, and strung, in which case the skin should be removed before rolling. Saddle of mutton, before being roasted, should be cleared of all its superfluous underlying fat; and the flanks should be so shortened as to just meet when drawn over the fillets. The overlying skin should be removed, and the saddle should be strung in five or six places to keep it in shape. In the case of a saddle of lamb, the skin need not be com- pletely removed, but slit in various places. As to neck of mutton, this should be shortened as for the cutting of ordinary cutlets ; the skin and the bones of the chine should be removed, as also the meat at the end of the rib-bonese down to two-thirds in. from the extremity of each. The cushion is then covered with slices of bacon, tied on with string. When the piece is roasted and dished, a frill should be placed on the end of each bared bone. Neck of mutton ought never to comprise more than nine to ten ribs, counting from the floating ones; it should consist of rather less if anything. Mutton Releves allow more particularly of vegetable and rice garnishes. Garnishes with sauces do not suit them so well, even when the pieces are braised. As for paste garnishes, such as macaroni, noodles, gniokis; they are seldom used. Garnishes for mutton releves should therefore be chosen, in preference, from among the following, the details of which I gave under \" Filet de Boeuf \" (Nos. 1044 to 1074) a\"d which I recall hereafter: — Andalouse, Bouquetiere, Chatelaine, Clamart, Dauphine, Dubarry, Duchesse, Japonaise, Jardiniere, Lorette, MacddoinCf Montmorency, Moderne, Nivernaise, Orientale, Petit-Due, Provengale, Renaissance, Richelieu, St. Germain. Apart from these compound garnishes, the following simple garnishes also suit admirably, either alone, or separated by some kind of potato preparation : — Braised Lettuce, stuffed with ordinary forcemeat or rice. Cabbages, moulded to the shape of small balls, braised and stuffed with fine mince-meat or rice. Haricot-beans, Peas and Broad-beans, cohered with butter. Asparagus-heads, white or green, cooked and cohered with butter. Celery, Endives, and Chicory, all braised. Brussels Sprouts, Cauliflowers, Brocoli, etc. Finally, the garnishes and modes of preparation termed : d I'Anglaise, a la Boulangere, Braises, Marine en Chevreuil, which I give below for the leg and the shoulder, may be applied perfectly well to other large pieces of mutton."

To Roast the Joint. — Withdraw it from the marinade and dry it thoroughly ; set it on a stand in the baking-tray ; and put it into a very fierce oven, that the meat may set immediately. The object of the very fierce oven is to prevent the juices absorbed from the marinade escaping in steam and thereby hardening the meat.

They are cut from either the fillet or the neck ; but, in the latter case, only the first six or seven ribs are used. Noisettes are grilled or sauted, and all the recipes given for Tournedos (Nos. 1077 to 1139) and for cutlets, may be applied to them."

        "instructions": "The minion fillets of mutton or lamb consist of the two muscles which lie under the saddle. Their mode of preparation changes according to their size. Thus, if they are small, they are served whole, after having been trimmed, sometimes larded; and sauted. If they are large, they are divided into two or three parts, cut laterally and aslant ; they are flattened, trimmed to the shape of ellipses, seasoned, dipped in melted butter, sprinkled with fine bread-crumbs, and finally, gently grilled. Minion fillets of beef, obtained from the narrow extremity or head of the fillet, are also used occasionally ; and these are generally flattened, dipped in butter and fine bread-crumbs, and grilled. These fillets are served chiefly with vegetable purees or with macedoines of fresh vegetables. The sauces best suited to them are the Bearnaise and the Robert Escoffier."

Set the boudins on willow lattices or baskets; plunge them into boiling water, and, from that time, keep the latter at 203° F. Let them poach for twenty minutes, and remember to prick all those that, by rising to the surface, show they contain air, e\\hich might burst their skins.

However deservedly pork may be praised, it could never have been included among the preparations of first-class cookery (except subsidiarily) had it not been for the culinary value of hams. With the latter it triumphs, and, be they of Bayonne or York, of Prague or Westphalia, no other joints enjoy more favour than these as Relevds. Though it is somewhat difficult to decide which one of the various kinds of ham should be adopted, in my opinion that of Bohemia, known as Prague ham, is best for a warm dish, and that of York for a cold dish. The latter is also excellent when served hot, but, even so, for this purpose it is inferior to the Prague kind, the delicacy of which is incomparable. Still, York ham ranks first in the opinion of many, for it should be remembered that England has no rival in the pre- paration of seasoned pork, and her famous bacon, the renown of which is enormous, constitutes one of the greatest discoveries in the science of gastronomy."
