        "instructions": "Aromatics play a very prominent part in cookery, and their combination with the condiments constitutes, as Grinod de la Reyniere said, \"the hidden soul of cooking.\" Their real object, in fact, is to throw the savour of dishes into relief, to intensify that savour, and to give each culinary preparation its particular stamp. They are all derived from the vegetable kingdom ; but, while some are used dry, others are used fresh. The first-named should belong to the permanent kitchen stock ; they are : sage, basil, rosemary, sweet marjoram, thyme, and bay. Also to be included in the permanent stock are : cinnamon, ginger, juniper-berries, nutmeg, cloves, mace, and vanilla. The last-named comprise those aromatic herbs used fresh, such as : parsley, chervil, tarragon, pimpernel, and common savory ; while, under this head, there may also be included : bits of common- and Seville-orange rind and zests of lemon rind."

        "instructions": "Seasonings are divided into several classes, which com. prise : — 1. Saline seasonings. — Salt, spiced salt, saltpetre. 2. Acid seasonings. — Plain vinegar, or the same aromatised with tarragon ; verjuice, lemon juice, and common- or Seville- orange juices. 3. Hot seasonings. — Peppercorns, ground or concassed pepper, or mignonette; paprika, curry, cayenne, and com- pound spices. 4. Saccharine seasonings. — Sugar and honey. Condiments are likewise subdivided, the three classes being : — (i) The pungents. — Onions, shallots, garlic, chives, and horseradish. 2. Hot condiments. — Mustard, gherkins, capers, English sauces, such as Worcester, Harvey, Ketchup, Escoffier's sauces, &c.; the wines used in reductions and braisings; the finishing elements of sauces and soups. 3. Fatty substances. — Most animal fats, butter, vegetable greases (edible oils and cocoanut butter). Remarks. — In cookery it should be borne in mind that both excellence and eatableness depend entirely upon a judicious use and a rational blending of the aromatics, seasonings, and con- diments. And, according as the latter have been used and apportioned, their action will be either beneficial or injurious to the health of the consumer. In the matter of seasoning there can be no question of approximation or half measures; the quantities must be exact, allowing only of slight elasticity in respect of the various tastes to be satisfied."

        "title": "PEELED, CHANNELLED, AND ZESTED LEMONS",
        "instructions": "Lemons are greatly used in cookery, as dish and comestible garnish. When a whole lemon is used for marinades of fish, for the \" bluncs,\" &c., it is well to peel it to the pulp, i.e., to remove the peel and the whole of the underlying white. The lemon is then cut into more or less large slices, according to the use for which it is intended. The rind of a lemon thus peeled may be cut into bits and used in this form as the necessity arises. When cutting it up, flatten the rind inside uppermost on the table, and, with a very sharp and flexible knife, remove all the white; then slice the remaining peel (which constitutes what is called zest) into strips about one inch wide, and cut these laterally in fine julienne- fashion. Scald the resulting bits for five minutes, cool them, drain them carefully, and put them aside until wanted. Sometimes, instead of cutting julienne-fashion, the zest may be finely chopped, but the rest of the process remains the same. Lemons are channelled by means of a little knife, or a special instrument for the purpose, which excises parallel ribbons from the surface of the rind and lays the white bare. A lemon channelled in this way is cut in two, lengthwise with the core ; its two extremities are removed, and the two halves are cut laterally into thin, regular slices to look like serrated half-discs. The lemon may also be cut at right angles to the core. Fried fish, oysters, and certain game are generally garnished with lemon slices fashioned according to the taste of the cook ; but the simplest, and perhaps the best, way is to cut the lemon through the centre, after having trimmed the two ends quite straight, and then to remove the rind roughly from the edge. For whatever purpose the lemon be intended, it should be, as far as possible, only prepared at the last moment. If it must be prepared beforehand, it would be well to keep it in a bowl of fresh water. 1 80— SHALLOTS Chopped Shallots. — Clean the shallots, and, by means of a very sharp knife, cut them lengthwise into thin slices ; let these cling together by not allowing the knife to cut quite through them, and, this done, turn them half round and proceed in the same way at right angles to the other cuts. Finally, cut them laterally, and this will be found to produce very fine and regular, small cubes. Ciseled Shallots. — The name \" ciseled shallots\" is often erroneously given to those shallots resulting from the above process. But ciseled shallots are merely laterally sliced, the result ot which operation is a series of thin, regular discs. Ciseled or chopped shallots should, when possible, only be prepared when required; if, however, they must be treated in advance, they should be kept somewhere in the cool until wanted. 181-SPICES Strictly speaking, spices include cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, mace ; and the many varieties of peppers and pimenta, cayenne, paprika, &c. These various condiments are found ready-made on the market, and they need only be kept dry in air-tight boxes in order to prevent the escape of their aroma. But there is another kind of preparation, in cookery, to which the name of spice or all-spice is more especially given. Nowadays several market varieties of this preparation exist, and vie with each other for custom, though in most cases they deserve it equally well. Formerly this was not so, and every chef had his own formula. The following is a recipe for the spice in question, which would be found useful if it had to be prepared at a moment's notice : — Obtain the following, very dry. 5 oz. of bay leaves. 4 oz. of cloves. 3 oz. of thyme (half of it wild, if 3 oz. of ginger-root, possible). 3 oz. of mace. 3 oz. of coriander. 10 oz. of mixed pepper (half black 4 oz. of cinnamon. and half white). 6 oz. of nutmeg. i oz. of cayenne. Put all these ingredients into a mortar and pound them until they are all able to pass through a very fine sieve. Put the resulting powder into an air-tight box, which must be kept dry. Before being used, this spice is generally mixed with salt (No. 188)."

        "title": "PARSLEY",
        "instructions": "Chopped Parsley. — If parsley be properly chopped, no juice should be produced. If, on the contrary, the operation be per- formed badly, it amounts to a process of pounding which, per- force, expresses the juice. In the latter case the particles cohere, and they are sprinkled with difficulty over an object. To remedy this shortcoming, wash the choppings in fresh water, as in the case of the onion, pressing in a similar manner so as to expel the water. Concussed Parsley is that kind which is roughly chopped. When a culinary preparation is dressed with concussed parsley, the latter should be added to it a few moments before serving, in order to undergo a slight cooking process; whereas chopped parsley may be strewn over a dish at the last moment. It should be remembered that parsley, when quite fresh and used in moderation, is an excellent thing; but, should it have remained too long in the heat, it becomes quite insufferable. I cannot, therefore, too strongly urge the advisability of using it in the freshest possible state, and it would even be wiser to discard it entirely than to be forced to ignore this condition. Parsley Sprays. — These are chiefly used in garnishing dishes, and it is well for the purpose to make as much use as possible of the curled-leaf kind, after having removed the long stalks. Keep the sprays in fresh water until required. Fried Parsley. — This consists of the sprays, well drained of watei»after washing, and immersed for an instant in very hot fat. The moment it is fried carefully drain it, salt it, and place it in a clean towel, where it may get rid of any superfluous grease. It is used to dress fried viands."

        "instructions": "Two kinds of salt are used in cooking, viz., grey, or sea-salt, and rock-salt. Grey-salt is used more especially for Brines and in the preparation of ices, as its grey colour does not allow of its being used indiscriminately. Be this as it may, many prefer it to rock-salt for the salting of stock-pots, roasts, and grills. For the last two purposes it is crushed with a roller, without being pounded, and the result should be such that every grain is distinctly perceptible to the touch. This salt, in melting over a roast or a grill, certainly imparts a supplementary flavour to the latter which could not be got with the use of rock-salt. Rock-salt. — This is found on the market in the forms of cooking and table-salt. If the kitchen is only supplied with cooking salt, the quantity required for several days should be dried, pounded in the mortar, and passed through a fine sieve; and then put aside in a dry place for use when wanted. Even table-salt, as it reaches one from the purveyor, sometimes needs drying and passing through a sieve before being used. Spiced Salt. — This condiment, which serves an important purpose in the preparation of pies and galantines, is obtained from a mixture of one lb. of table salt with three and one-half oz. of spices (No. 181). This kind of salt should be carefully kept in a very dry place. 2. The Various Kinds of Garnishes for Soups, Releves, AND Entrees, Hot or Cold stuffings AND FORCEMEATS"

Remarks Relative to Mousseline Forcemeat. — This, like the preceding forcemeats, may be prepared from any kind of meat. The addition of the white of egg is not essential if the meats used already possess a certain quantity of albumen ; but without the white of egg the forcemeat absorbs much less cream. This forcemeat is particularly suited to preparations with a shell-fish base. Incomparably delicate results are obtained by the process, while it also furnishes ideal quenelles for the pur- pose of garnishing soup. In a word, it may be said of mousse- line forcemeat that, whereas it can replace all other kinds, none of these can replace it.

Thus the weight of meat afforded by a fowl weighing four lbs. is estimated at twenty oz. after deducting the fillets which are always reserved. Hence the quantities for the forcemeat are regulated thus : — Chicken-meat, twenty oz. ; lean pork, eight oz. ; fillet of veal, eight oz.; fresh, fat bacon, thirty oz.; whole eggs, five; spiced salt, two oz. ; brandy, one-fifth pint.

        "title": "FORCEMEAT BALLS OR QUENELLES",
        "instructions": "Divers ways of Moulding and Poaching them. — Whatever be the required size or shape of quenelles there are four ways of making them : — (i) By rolling them ; (2) by moulding them with a spoon ; (3) by forming them with a piping-bag ; (4) by mould- ing them by hand into the shape of a kidney. 1. To roll quenelles it is necessary to keep the forcemeat somewhat stiff, and therefore this process could not well apply to the mousseline forcemeats. Place one-quarter lb. of forcemeat, when ready, on a floured board, and, with hands covered in flour, roll the preparation until it has lengthened itself into the form of a sausage, the thickness of which depends upon the required size of the intended quenelles. Cut up the sausage of forcemeat laterally with a floured knife, and roll each section with the finger-ends until the length it assumes is thrice that of its diameter. The balls should be put aside on a floured tray as soon as they are made. The Poaching of Rolled Quenelles. — When all the force- meat has been used up, the balls are gently tilted into a sauce- pan containing boiling, salted water, so calculated in quan- tity as to allow of their not being too tightly squeezed. The saucepan is covered and kept on the side of the fire until all the balls have risen to the surface and are almost out of the water. They are then removed with a skimmer and placed in a bowl of cold water. At last, when they have properly cooled, they are carefully drained on a cloth and put aside on a dish until required. When the quenelles are needed for immediate use it would be better not to cool them. 2. To Mould Quenelles with a Spoon. — This method may be applied to all forcemeats, and allows of the balls being much softer, as the forcemeat need not be so stiff. First, butter the sautepan or the tray, whereon the balls are to be laid, by means of a brush, and let the butter cool. Put the sautepan on the table in front and a little to the right of one; on the left, place the sautepan or bowl contain- ing the forcemeat, and on the further side of the buttered saute- pan there should be a receptacle containing hot water, into which the spoon used for moulding is inserted. For ordinary quenelles two coffee-spoons are used, one of which is kept in the hot water as stated above. Now, with the other held in the left hand, take up a little of the forcemeat (just enough to fill the spoon) ; withdraw the second spoon from the hot water and place it, with its convex side uppermost, on the other spoon . This smoothens the upper surface of the forcemeat. Now, with the help of the second spoon, remove the whole of the contents of the first spoon, and overturn the second spoon on the spot in the tray or sautepan which the ball is intended to occupy. The second spoon, being at once moist and hot, allows the forcemeat to leave it quite easily in the shape of a large olive. Renew this operation until the whole of the force- meat has been used. The Poaching of Spoon-moulded Quenelles. — When all the balls have been moulded, place the tray on the side of the stove and pour enough boiling, salted water over them to moisten them abundantly. Leave them to poach, and from time to time move the tray ; then, when they have swollen suffi- ciently and seem soft and firm to the touch, drain them. If they are to be used at once they should be placed directly in the sauce. If they have been prepared in advance, it would be well to cool them as directed under rolled quenelles. 3. To Form Quenelles with a Piping-bag. — This process is especially recommended for small, fine, and light forcemeat balls intended for soup garnish. For, besides being extremely quick, it allows of making them in any desirable size or shape. Butter a tray or a sautepan, and leave to cool. Put the forcemeat into a bag fitted with a pipe at its narrowest end. The pipe may be grooved or smooth, and its size must be in accordance with that intended for the proposed balls. Now squeeze out the latter, proceeding in the usual way and laying them very closely. The Poaching of Quenelles m,ade by the above Process, with ordinary or Mousseline Forcemeat. — These quenelles are poached in exactly the same way as the spoon-moulded ones. The Poaching of Godiveau Quenelles made with a Piping-bag. — These quenelles or balls are laid on a piece of fine, buttered paper, which in its turn is placed upon a buttered tray. The godiveau must not be too stiff, and the balls are laid by means of the piping-bag side by side and slightly touching one another. When the tray is covered push it into a very moderate oven for a few minutes. The balls are poached when a thin dew of grease may be seen to glisten on their surfaces. On the appearance of this dew withdraw them from the oven and overturn the tray, carefully, upon a marble slab, taking care that the tray does not press at all upon the balls, lest it crush them. When the latter are nearly cold the paper which covers them is taken off with caution, and all that remains to be done is to put them carefully away on a dish until they are wanted. 4. To Mould Forcemeat with the Fingers. — This excellent process is as expedient as that of the bag, and it produces beautifully shaped balls. Place on the edge of a table, in front of one, a saucepan three-quarters full of boiling, salted water, the handle of the receptacle being turned to the far side. Now take a piece of string one yard in length, double it over, and tie the free ends to a weight of two lbs., letting the two strands twist round each other. This done, there should be a loop at the top of the string. Put this loop round the handle of the saucepan, and draw the string diametrically across the latter, letting the weight pull the string tightly down on the side opposite to the handle. When this has been effected the operator, with his left hand, takes some of the forcemeat, smoothening it with a spoon, and, placing the spoon near the string with his right, first finger, he removes from its extremity a portion of the prepara- tion about equal to the intended size of the balls. This portion of the forcemeat remaining suspended on his first finger, the operator now scrapes the latter across the string, and the ball falls beneath into the saucepan containing the water. When all the stuffing has been moulded in this way the saucepan is placed on the fire to complete the poaching of the balls, and the precautions indicated in the preceding processes are ob- served.

        "instructions": "Put one oz. of chervil into one pint of boiling consomm6, cover the saucepan, and let infusion proceed away from the fire for twenty minutes. Now pour this infusion over two eggs and six yolks, beaten briskly in a basin, and mix with the whisk. Strain through muslin, and carefully remove there- from the froth that has formed. Pour into buttered moulds; poach in a bain-marie, as in the case of cream, and take great care that the water in the bain-marie does not boil. According to the way in which the royale is to be divided, it may be poached either in large or small \"Charlotte\" moulds; but the latter, large and small alike, must be well buttered. If the preparation be put into large moulds, thirty-five or forty minutes should be allowed for poaching ; if, on the other hand, the moulds are small, about fifteen minutes would suffice. Always let the royale cool in the moulds."
