        "instructions": "Having thus frozen the preparation, it may now be set in rock- form on a napkin, as it used sometimes to be served in the past, or in glasses. But as a rule it is put into special moulds, having closely-fitting covers. These moulds should be carefully filled, and banged on a folded napkin, that the ice may settle and drive out any air which might be the cause of holes being found in the preparation. When it is filled, place the mould in a receptacle of a suitable size, and surround it with broken ice, prepared as for the packing. The mould should remain at least an hour in the ice, in the case of an ordinary ice, and an extra two hours if the ice be light and not previously frozen as are the Bombes. When about to serve, take the mould out of the ice ; wash it to rid it of the taint of salt ; dip it in tepid water for an instant, that the surface of the preparation inside may melt and separate easily from the mould. Overturn the mould ; and turn out the ice upon a folded napkin lying on a dish."

        "instructions": "Preparations for simple ices are of two kinds : those made from cream, and those made from syrup ; the latter being principally used for fruit ices. As the quantities of sugar and eggs used for these preparations vary exceedingly, the following recipes have been based upon a working average. If creamier ices be required, all that is needed is an increase in the sugar and egg-yolks per quart of milk ; while, if the ices be required harder but less creamy, the two ingredients above mentioned should be proportionately reduced. As an example of the difference that may exist between cream preparations, I might instance the case of ice-cream, which may be made from seven to sixteen egg-yolks, and six oz. to one lb. of sugar per quart of milk. In regard to ices made from syrups and fruit, their preparations may measure from 15° to 30° or 32°. (saccharometer) respectively."

For example, one of the covers may be garnished with straw- berry, and the other with violet preparation, while the central portion may hold a vanilla-flavoured preparation. After having frozen them for three hours, in a pail filled with freezing ice, and turned them out, these bricks are cut up vertically into rectangles, on the cut sides of which the differently coloured layers are distinctly marked. Place these rectangles in special paper cases ; decorate them on top, if the directions admit of it, and place them in a refrigerator until about to serve. Nearly all Bombe preparations may become the base of biscuits, which are then named after them ; e.g. : from Bombe Odessa, Odessa Iced Biscuits may be prepared. Various, Iced Biscuits."

The middle is then filled with a Bombe preparation, flavoured as directed, or with a Mousse preparation. The whole is then covered with a round piece of white paper, and the mould is hermetically sealed with its cover, set to freeze, and left for two or three hours in the ice. When about to serve, take the mould out of the ice ; wash it with cold water ; dip it quickly in tepid water ; dry it with a towel, and overturn the mould on a napkin or on a block of ice.

        "instructions": "Sherbets are made from any liqueur ice preparation at 15° ; or they may be prepared as follows : — For one quart of preparation, take the juice of two lemons and one orange, half-a-pint of port wine, of Samos wine, of Sauterne, or other good wine ; and add cold syrup at 22°, until the saccharometer registers 15°. For liqueur sherbets, allow about one-fifth pint of liqueur per quart of the preparation ; but remember that this is subject to the kind of liqueur used. For the quantity just prescribed, use syrup at 18° or 19°, which the subsequent addition of liqueur reduces to the proper degree. Whatever be the kind of liqueur, the latter should only be added when the Sherbet is completely frozen ; that is to say, at the last moment. Fruit Sorbets are generally prepared from the juices and syrups of aqueous fruits. Fruit purees are scarcely suited to this mode of procedure, and they are only resorted to in exceptional cases. The Freezing of Sherbets. — Pour the preparation into the turbine or the freezer, which should have been previously packed, and keep the utensil on the move. Remove portions of the preparation from the sides of the receptacle as fast as they adhere thereto, and mix them with the whole, until the latter is completely congealed ; re- membering not to stir at all during the freezing process. When the preparation is firm enough, mix with it, gently, the quarter of its weight of Italian meringue or very stiffly whipped cream ; and finish by the addition of the liqueur. The Dishing of Sherbets. — Take some of the Sherbet prepara- tion in a spoon, and set it in Sherbet or Sherry glasses, shaping it to a point. When the Sherbet is prepared with wine, sprinkle the pre- paration when it is in the glasses with a tablespoonful of the selected wine. The consistence of a Sherbet, of what kind soever, should be such as to allow of its being drunk."
