The moisture of the peas and the lettuce suffices for the moistening, provided the stewpan be well covered and the fire be not too fierce — both of which conditions are necessary to prevent evaporation on too large a scale."

The Argenteuil asparagus — very much in demand while it is in season. 4. English asparagus, which is somewhat delicate in quality, but inclined to be small. During the season there are, besides, several other kinds of asparagus imported from Spain or France, which, though not equal to the four kinds above mentioned, may nevertheless be used for soups or gar- nishes instead of asparagus-heads or sprew. Asparagus should be had as fresh as possible; it should be cleaned with care, quickly washed, tied into faggots, and cooked in plenty of salted water. Certain kinds, the flavour of which is somewhat bitter, should be transferred to other water as soon as cooked, with the view of reducing their bitterness. Asparagus is dished on special silver drainers, or on napkins."

        "title": "THE PREPARATION OF RAVIOLI",
        "instructions": "They may be made in various shapes as follows : — (i) Roll a piece of noodle paste to a thin layer and stamp it out with a grooved cutter, two and one-half in. in diameter. Moisten the edges of each roundel of paste ; garnish the centre of each with a ball of one of the above stuffings, the size of a hazel-nut, and fold in slipper-form. (2) Roll the paste into a rectangle of four-in. sides; garnish with stuffing, leaving a gap between the portions of the latter ; moisten the edges of the paste, and close up by drawing these together. Finally stamp out with a grooved, crescent-shaped fancy-cutter. (3) Prepare a square layer of paste ; garnish it with lines con- sisting of portions of paste; leave a space of two in. between the lines. Moisten ; cover with a second layer of paste, of the same dimensions as the first, and divide up, by means of the roulette, into squares of two-in. sides. Whatever be the shape of the ravioli, plunge them into a saucepan of slightly salted boiling water; poach them for from eight to ten minutes, and drain them. Set them on a buttered gratin-dish, sprinkled with grated cheese ; sprinkle them with good beef gravy ; then again with grated cheese, and set the gratin to form. Or, dish the ravioli in layers, sprinkling each layer with grated cheese and gravy. Complete with some grated cheese, and set the gratin to form in the usual way. N.B. — The ravioli may also be served, merely sprinkled with grated cheese and nut-brown butter. CHAPTER XIX SAVOURIES"

        "title": "REMARKS UPON SAVOURIES",
        "instructions": "I HAVE already expressed my opinion in regard to Savouries. I consider their use opposed to gastronomical principles, and that they have no raison d'etre on a good menu. But, not wishing to seem didactic, I shall give, hereafter, a few savoury recipes, selected from among those which are gastronomically the best, and which custom has sanctified. I resolved to make these recipes appear after the Vegetables and before the Ices, because I deem that Dessert alone is ad- missible after the Entremets and Ices. There is much in common between Hors-d'oeuvres and Savouries. Many of the former, the recipes for which I have given, may appear as Savouries, once their seasoning has been intensified. Among the latter class may be quoted the various Tartlets (No. 387, &c.); the Barquettes (No. 314); Frivolities (No. 350) ; Eclairs h la Karoly (No. 344) ; Allumettes aux Anchois (No. 300); City Toasts (No. 320), &c."

        "instructions": "Prepare a ribbon of puff-paste three inches wide by one- fifth inch thick, leaving the length to come as it will. Spread on it some very reduced Bechamel sauce, combined with two tablespoonfuls of grated Gruyere cheese per one-half pint, and season with cayenne. Sprinkle the surface with grated Parmesan ; press the latter into the sauce by means of the flat of a knife; cut into rectangles one inch wide; set these on a slightly-moistened tray, and bake them in a moderate oven for twelve minutes."
