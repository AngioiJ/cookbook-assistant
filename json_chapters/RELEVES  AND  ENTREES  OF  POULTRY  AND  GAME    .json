        "title": "THE WAY TO SERVE POULTRY RELEVeS",
        "instructions": "QUICKLY AND HOT I feel bound to call the reader's attention to this very im- portant point in culinary work : — Owing to the difficulties involved in the carving of the fowl and the placing and arranging of the pieces and their garnish upon the consumers' plates — both of which operations require dexterity and expertness, which those in charge very often do not possess, or thanks to the inefficiency of particular installa- tions, or what not, I have noticed for some considerable time, that the method of serving large pieces of poultry is, in many cases, very far from being the right one. For, indeed, how often does not the diner find himself pre- sented with a plate of fowl which is neither appetisingly dainty nor yet sufficiently hot ! It follows from this, that all the care and trouble devoted by a chef to the preparation of the dish are entirely wasted. Now, I have tried to improve this state of affairs, by planning a method of serving which would be at once simple and expeditious, without necessarily being devoid of tastefulness and presentability. POULTRY 475 In the first place, it is my practice to remove the fowl's two supremes, in the kitchen, and to keep them warm in a little Gooking-liquor until the last minute. Secondly, I remove all the bones of the breast, and I reconstruct the fowl with a garnish in keeping with the dish, i.e., either a mousseline force- meat, pilaff rice combined with cream, foie gras and truffles, spaghetti, or noodles with cream. Having properly smoothed and arranged the selected gar- nish, the fowl may now be placed, either at one end of any but a round dish, or on a low cushion of fried bread, on which it may be set firmly. It may also be entirely coated with Mornay sauce, sprinkled with grated cheese, and speedily glazed. When the body of the bird is dished, its garnish should be set round it in fine, tartlet crusts ; its supremes, quickly sliced, should be distributed among the tartlets, and the dish sent to the table with the sauce separately. By this means, it reaches the table hot, it is served quickly and cleanly; and every person gets a slice of meat, and not garnish only, as was so often the case formerly. Instead of tartlets, one may use thin croutons of bread, of the size of the slices of chicken, and fried in fresh butter. Thus, for a \" Poularde a la Derby,\" after having stuffed the pullet with rice, suppressed the bones of the breast, and removed the supremes ; all that is necessary is to properly shape the rice, and to dish the fowl on a cushion. This done, prepare as many croutons and slices of foie- gras, sauted in butter, as there are diners, and arrange them round the pullet — the slices of foie-gras lying on the croutons. Now, quickly cut the supremes into slices; put one of these on each slice of foie-gras, and on each of the latter put a slice of truffle. Put the pullet, thus prepared, in the oven for a few minutes; let it get very hot, and send it to the table with the sauce separately. In the dining-room the Maitre-d'h6tel quickly serves the garnished croutons on hot plates, beside each crouton he puts a tablespoonful of the rice with which the pullet has been stuffed, and, finally, a tablespoonful of sauce. In less than two minutes after its entrance into the dining- room, the pullet is thus served warm to each person. Of course, the above measures refer to the fowl that has to be dished whole and presented ; but, when this is not required, the rice withdrawn from the cooked bird need only be set in the centre of a deep, square entree dish (fitted with a cover), and surrounded by the sliced supremes, with intercalated slices of foie-gras and truffle. The sauce is also served separately in this case. Cover the dish, so that it may stand and keep hot a few minutes, if necessary, without spoiling. The legs, which are rarely served at a well-ordered dinner, remain in the kitchen together with the carcass. I cannot too strongly recommend the system just described, whenever the circumstances allow of its being put into practice. It is the only one that ensures an efficient service, calculated to give entire satisfaction to all concerned."

        "title": "POULETS SAUTES",
        "instructions": "As I pointed out at the beginning of Part V. of this chapter, the chickens best suited to the saute treatment are those termed \" kla Reine \" ; they should be of medium size, very fleshy, and tender. In an extreme case, small pullets or large chickens might be used, but neither of these are so eminently suited to the pro- cedure in question as chickens \" a la Reine.\" The fowl which is to be sauted should be cut up thus : after having emptied, singed, and thoroughly cleaned it; cut off its legs — quite a simple matter, since all that is necessary is the disjunction of the thigh-bones, after having cut the skin. Cut off the claws just below the joint of the tibia, and pare the spurs. Now cut the tibia above the joint, and remove the thigh-bonci Cut the pinions at the first joint; remove the wings, after having cut round a portion of the breast in such wise that each wing holds one half of it; finally detach the centrepiece or breast-bone, which should be left whole if the fowl be small and cut into two if it be otherwise. The carcass thus remains. Cut it into two, and trim each piece on both sides. Before setting them to cook, moderately season the pieces of fowl with salt and pepper. Whatever the demands of a par- ticular recipe may be, the preparatory principle of sauted chickens is always as follows : — ■ Take a sautepan just large enough to hold the pieces of fowl, and heat therein two oz. of clarified butter; or, according to circumstances, half butter and half good oil. When the selected fat is quite hot, insert the pieces of fowl ; let them colour quickly, and turn them over from time to time, that they may do so evenly. Now cover the utensil, and put it in a sufficiently hot oven to ensure the complete cooking of the fowl. Some tender pieces, such as the wings and the breast, should be withdrawn after a few minutes have elapsed, and kept warm ; but the legs, the meat of which is firmer and thicker, should cook seven or eight minutes more at least. When all the pieces are cooked, withdraw them ; drain away their butter, and swill the sautepan with the prescribed liquor, which is either some kind of wine, mushroom cooking-liquor, or chicken stock, &c. This swilling forms, as I have already pointed out, an essential part of the procedure, inasmuch as its object is to dissolve those portions of solidified gravy which adhere to the bottom of the sautepan. Reduce the swilling-liquor to half, and add thereto the sauce given in the recipe. Put the pieces of carcass, the claws, the pinions and the legs into this sauce, and simmer for a few POULTRY 497 minutes. The other pieces, i.e., the wings and breast, are then added, but when the sauce is sufficiently reduced, it must stop boiling. When the pieces are completely cooked, it is obviously unnecessary for the sauce to boil, since the former would only be hardened thereby. A few minutes before serving, put the pieces into a deep entree dish (fitted with a cover) in the following order : — The pieces of carcass, the claws and the pinions on the bottom of the dish, upon these the legs and the breast, and, last of all, the wings. The sauce is then finished according to the directions of the recipe, and is poured over the pieces of fowl. Some chickens are prepared without colouration — that is to say, the pieces are merely stiffened in butter without browning, and their cooking is completed in the oven as above. In this case the swilling-liquor is invariably white, as also the supple- mentary sauces, and the latter are finished with cream."

When supremes are taken from a small chicken, the minion fillets are not removed; if the chicken be an ordinary one or a pullet, the minion fillets are removed, cleared of all tendons, and twisted into rings or crescents, after having been contised with slices of truffle tliat are half-inserted into the little incisions, made at regular intervals in the meat with the point of a knife. Prepared in this way, these fillets are generally included in the garnish of the supremes. Chicken ailerons and cutlets (the latter must not be mistaken for those prepared from cooked meat and which are only a kind of croquette) are suprimes to which the humerus-bone of the wing is left adhering. Cutlets are always cut from such fowls as chickens k la Reine, or very fleshy, spring chickens. The same rule applies to suprimes : though, sometimes, the latter are cut from pullets. But, in that case, as they would be too large, they are cut into three or four very regular pieces, which are slightly flattened,- and trimmed to the shape of hearts or ovals ; except when they have to be stuffed. In the latter case, they are opened in the thickness, by means of the point of a small knife, to form sacks; and, in the resulting interstice the selected stuffing is inserted, with the help of a piping-bag fitted with a little, even pipe, and in a sufficient quantity to fill out the supremes well. Supremes and cutlets are always cooked without liquor, or almost so ; for should any moistening liquid even approach the boil, it would immediately harden them. If they be desired poached, it would be best to cook the whole fowl, and cut them from the latter when it is cooked. This is how they are prepared, according as to whether they be required colourless or sauted; though the brown method of preparing them is applied more particularly to cutlets. Cutlets or supremes sauted : Season them with salt ; roll them in flour; set them in a vegetable pan containing some very hot clarified butter, and quickly gild them on both sides. These pieces of fowl are so tender that they are cooked and gilded at the same moment of time. Cutlets or supremes prepared without colouration : Season them, and set them in a vegetable-pan, containing some fresh, melted, unclarified butter. Roll the supremes in this butter; add a few drops of lemon juice ; thoroughly seal the vegetable- pan, and put it in a very hot oven. A few minutes suffice for the poaching of the suprSmes, which are known to be ready when they seem resilient to the touch, and are perfectly white. Important Remarks : Chicken Supremes or cutlets should never be allowed to wait, lest they harden. They should be cooked quickly, at the last moment; dished and served imme- diately. The shortest wait is enough to spoil them, and to make an insipid and dry preparation of what should be an exquisite dish. N.B. — The recipes given hereafter for supremes may of course be applied to fillets, cutlets, ailerons, blanc de poulet, &c."

They were also dished on stearine tazzas, made in special moulds ; but these methods, however much they may have been honoured by old cookery, are generally scouted at the present day. The method of dishing detailed hereafter is steadily ousting them ; it allows of serving much more delicate and more agree- able chaud-froids in the simplest possible way, and was inaugurated at my suggestion at the Savoy Hotel. Modern method of dishing : Set the decorated pieces, coated with chaud-froid sauce, side by side on a layer of excellent aspic jelly, lying on the bottom of a deep square dish. Cover them with the same aspic, which should be half melted, and leave to set. When about to serve, incrust the dish in a block of carved ice, or surround it with the latter fragmented.

The latter invariably yield a dry forcemeat, whatever measures one may take in the preparation. The fowl should be cleaned but not emptied, and it should be carefully boned ; the process beginning from an incision down the skin of the back, from the head to the tail. This done, carefully remove the meat with the point of a POULTRY 539 small, sharp knife, until the carcass is quite bare. Cut off the wings and the legs, flush with the articulations of the trunk ; remove all the meat that the skin may be quite clean, and spread the skin on a clean piece of linen. Trim the meat of the breast, cut it into pieces one-third inch square, and put the resulting trimmings aside. Season these pieces and marinade them in a few drops of brandy ; prepare other pieces of the same size and length from four oz. of truffles; six oz. of salted, fat pork; four oz. of cooked ham, and four oz. of salted and cooked ox-tongue. Then clear the meat of the legs of all tendons; add to it the trimmings cut from the breast, as much very white veal and twice as much very fat, fresh pork ; season these meats with salt, pepper and nutmeg; chop them up very finely; pound them, and rub them through a sieve. Add the brandy in which the fillets were marinaded. Spread a layer, three in. wide, of this forcemeat along the whole of the middle of the chicken's skin; upon this layer of forcemeat set the strips of bacon, fowl, truffle, ham, and tongue, arranging them alternately and regularly ; upon them spread another layer of forcemeat, equal to the first ; then another layer of the various pieces, and finally cover and envelop the whole in what remains of the forcemeat. Draw the skin of the fowl over the whole and completely wrap the former round the latter. Carefully sew up the edges of the skin, and roll the galantine in a napkin, either end of which should be tightly strung. With six lbs. of shin of veal, one-half lb. of fresh blanched pork rind, and the fowl's carcass, prepare a white veal stock (No. lo). When this stock has cooked for about five hours, add the galantine to it, and gently cook the latter for about one and one-quarter hours. At the end of this time take the galantine off the fire ; drain it on a dish, and let it cool for ten minutes ; remove the napkin in which it has cooked, and roll it in another one which should be similarly tied at both ends. This done, put the galantine to cool under a weight not exceeding five or six lbs. The cooking-liquor, once it has been cleared of grease and clarified as for an aspic (No. 158), constitutes a jelly which accompanies the galantine. When the latter is quite cold, remove the napkin covering it, trim it neatly at either end ; coat it with half-melted jelly, and dish it on a low cushion of carved rice.

Put it on the side of the fire, add the yolks of three eggs, stirring briskly the while, and add, little by little, six oz. of very good, fresh butter, just as for a Hollandaise sauce. Finally, add one and one-half leaves of gelatine, dissolved in two tablespoonfuls of boiling water, and rub the whole through tammy. Meanwhile, raise the chicken's fillets and cut them into wide and thin coUops, after having cleared them of skin. Cover each collop with a slice of truffle dipped in good, half-melted jelly, and with them line the bottom and sides of a timbale-mould, already clothed with jelly and incrusted in ice. Then completely bone the chicken ; finely pound the remainder of its meat as well as the skin ; rub the whole through a fine sieve, and add the resulting purine to the prepared sauce. Mix the whole well, and fill the mould with it. Allow to set well, and turn out on a cushion of rice surrounded by fine croutons of jelly. N.B. — By substituting young ducks, young pigeons, or some kind of game such as pheasant, woodcock, &c., for the chicken, this recipe may be applied to any piece of poultry or game. 171 o— SUPREME DE VOLAILLE J E ANNETTE Poach a fowl ; let it cool ; raise its supremes, and cut each into four collops, trimmed to the shape of ovals. Coat these collops with white chaud-froid sauce, and decorate them with tarragon leaves, blanched, cooled, well-drained and very green. Let a layer of aspic jelly one-half in. thick set on the bottom of a timbale or a square dish ; upon this layer set some slices of foie-gras Parfait, cut to the shape of the collops, and place one of the latter on each slice of the Parfait. This done, cover with fine half-melted chicken jelly. When about to serve, incrust the dish or the timbale in a block of carved ice. POULTRY 541"

The quantities and the mode of procedure for cold fowl mousse are those given under \" mousse de tomates \" (No. 814). The various mousse recipes which I gave for trout (Nos. 813 and 815) may be applied to cold fillets of fowl. In this case, the latter may be coated with some kind of chaud-froid sauce, or simply glazed with jelly, and soberly decorated. These mousses constitute excellent dishes for suppers, and from a very long list of them I may quote : — Mousse de jambon au blanc de poulet. Mousse de foie gras au blanc de poulet. Mousse de langue au blanc de poulet. Mousse de tomates au blanc de poulet. Mousse d'ecrevisses au blanc de poulet. Mousse d'airelles ou de canneberges au blanc de poulet.

With what remains of the fowl's meat, as much lean pork and veal (mixed in equal quantities) and twice as much fresh, pork fat (i.e., a quantity equal in weight to all the other meats put together), prepare a very smooth forcemeat; chopping the whole first, then pounding it and rubbing it through a sieve. Add to this forcemeat a little truffle essence; the marinade of the fillets; one raw egg, and the necessary sea- soning, to wit : salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Line the bottom and sides of the pie with this forcemeat; on this first layer of forcemeat lay a thin slice of bacon and thick slices of tongue, beef, or ham. Place thereon another slice of bacon, followed by a thin layer of forcemeat, a layer of truffle slices, another layer of forcemeat, the collops of fowl, another layer of forcemeat, one more layer of truffles, one more layer of forcemeat, and one more layer of tongue or ham (between two thin slices of bacon) ; and finally cover the whole with what remains of the forcemeat and a slice of larding bacon superposed by a bay-leaf. Now close the pie with a cover of the same paste as that already used, carefully seal down the cover to the crest of the underlying paste, trim and pinch the crest, and deck this cover of paste with imitation- leaves of the same paste. Make a slit in the top of the pie, for the escape of steam ; carefully gild the cover and the crest, and bake in a moderate oven for about one and one-quarter hours.

N.B. — With this recipe as model, and by substituting another piece of poultry or game for the fowl, raised pies may be prepared from every kind of game or poultry, except water- game, which only yields mediocre results. In the case of game pies, the forcemeat is combined with cne-sixth of its weight of gratin forcemeat (No. 202) and an equal quantity of fat bacon is suppressed.

When they are properly prepared, they constitute one of the most savoury luncheon entries that can be served. The pinions of large pullets may be treated in this way. Clear and singe the pinions, and set them in a buttered sautepan, just large enough to hold them. Colour gently on both sides and drain. In the same butter, gently brown a sliced carrot and onion, to which add a few parsley stalks and a little thyme and bay. Set the pinions on these aromatics ; season moderately with salt and pepper; cover the sautepan, and continue cooking gently in a very slow oven, basting often the while. The dish will be all the better for having been cooked slowly and regularly. Do not moisten, if possible, or, at the most, only do so with a few drops of water, in order to keep the butter from clarifying — not an unusual occurrence when the heat is too fierce. When the pinions are cooked, dish them radially, and cover them that they may keep warm. Add a few tablespoonfuls of light stock or some water to the cooking butter, and set to boil gently for fifteen minutes. When this stock is sufficiently reduced to only half-immerse the pinions, pass it through a fine strainer and clear of some of the grease if necessary; remember, however, that this stock should be somewhat fat.

        "title": "FOIE GRAS",
        "instructions": "Foies gras are supplied either by geese or ducks. Goose's liver is larger, firmer and less readily melted than that of the duck. As a rule the former should be selected in preference, more particularly in the matter of hot dishes. Nevertheless, failing goose's liver, duck's liver may be used and with very good results when its quality is good. Foies gras are used in the preparation of terrines, raised pies, parfaits and mousses, which are among the most delicate and richest of cold dishes. They may also be used as a garnishing ingredient, in the form of coUops or mousseline quenelles. Finally, they may also be served as hot entries. When a whole foie gras is to be served hot, it must first be trimmed, studded with raw truffles which have been previously peeled, quartered, seasoned with salt and pepper, stiffened in a glassful of brandy, together with a bay-leaf, and cooled in a thoroughly closed terrine. When the foie gras has been studded with truffles, wrap it in thin slices of bacon or a piece of pig's caul, and set it in a thoroughly-sealed terrine before cooking it. The best way to cook foie gras, when it is to be served whole and hot, is to bake it in a crust of paste that can absorb the excess of grease produced by the melting of the liver. For this purpose prepare two layers of patty paste, a little larger than the liver. On one of these layers, set the liver wrapped in slices of bacon; and, if possible, surround it with whole fair-sized truffles, peeled. Set half a bay-leaf on the liver; moisten the edges of the paste; cover the whole with the other layer of paste; seal it down with the thumb, and fold over the edges of the paste to form a regular, ornamented border which, besides N N 2 finishing off the preparation, also increases the strength of the welding. Gild the top; streak; make a slit in the top for the escape of the steam ; and, in the case of a medium-sized liver, cook in a good, moderate oven for from forty to forty-five minutes. Serve this crust as it stands, and send the garnish separately. In the dining-room, the waiter in charge removes the top of the crust, cuts out the liver with a spoon, setting a piece on each plate, and arranges around each piece the garnish mentioned on the menu. I am not partial to the cooking of foie gras in a terrine when it is to be served hot. In any case the method described above strikes me as being much the best, whatever be the garnish that is served with the liver. I particularly recommend a garnish of noodles, macaroni, lazagnes, spaghetti and even rice, with hot foie gras. These pastes should simply be cooked in water and finished with cream. This accompaniment makes the foie gras much more digestible and palatable. The best garnishes for hot foie gras, besides those given above, are truffles, whole or in slices, or a Financiere. In the matter of brown sauces, a Madeira sauce suits admirably, provided it be of great delicacy and not overcharged with Madeira; but a very light buttered, veal or chicken glaze, combined with a little old Sherry or old Port, is even superior. A Hongroise sauce with paprika or an excel- lent supreme sauce may also be served when the garnish admits of it."

After having studded the foie gras with truffles and placed it in a closed terrine as above, wrap it in slices of bacon, set it to poach in a moderate oven for twenty minutes, and leave it to cool. Line a buttered timbale-mould, of a size in proportion to that of the liver, with a thick layer of ordinary unsugared brioche paste (No. 2370).

Ducks and Ducklings (Canards et Canetons) Three varieties of the duck family are recognised in cookery, viz., the Nantes duck, the Rouen duck, and the different kinds of wild duck. The latter are generally used for roasts and in salmis. The Rouen duck is also served more often as a roast than as an entree. The characteristic trait of its preparation lies in its being kept very underdone, and it is very rarely braised. It is killed by suffocation, and not by bleeding, which is the usual mode of killing other birds. The Nantes duck, which is similar to the Aylesbury one, is not so fleshy as the Rouen duck, and may be roasted, poeled, or braised."

Releves and Entrees VENISON AND GROUND GAME The Stag (Fr. Cerf) and the fallow deer (Fr. Daim) supply the only venison that is consumed in England, where the roe- buck (Fr. Chevreuil) is not held in very high esteem. True, the latter's flesh is very often mediocre in quality, and saddles and legs of roebuck often have to be imported from the Continent when they are to appear on an important menu. On the other hand, venison derived from the stag or red deer and the fallow deer proper is generally of superior quality. The former has perhaps more flavour, but the latter, which is sup- plied by animals bred in herds on large private estates, has no equal as far as delicacy and tenderness are concerned, while it is covered with white and scented fat, which is greatly appre- ciated by English connoisseurs. Although these two kinds of venison are generally served as releves, they belong more properly to the roasts, and I shall give their recipes a little later on. In any case, only half of the hind-quarters (that is to say, the leg together with that part of the saddle which reaches from it to the floating ribs) is served at high-class tables. I shall now, therefore, only give the various recipes dealing with roebuck, it being understood that these, if desired, may be applied to corresponding joints of the stag or deer."

The recipes for saddle which I give hereafter may therefore be applied equally well to legs. Whichever joint be selected, it must first be cleared of all tendons and then larded with larding bacon. The last opera- tion is no more essential than is the marinading which in France has become customary with such pieces. It might even be said with justice that marinading is not only useless, but harmful, more particularly in the case of young animals whose meat has been well hung. Unlike many other specimens of game, roebuck has to be eaten fresh; it does not suit it to be in the least tainted. I should like to point out here that game shot in ambush is best, owing to the fact that animals killed after a chase decom- pose very quickly, and thereby lose a large proportion of their flavour. The saddle of the roebuck generally consists of the whole of the latter's back, from the withers to the tail, in which case the bones of the ribs are cut very short, that the joint may lie steady at all points. At the croup-end, cut the joint on either side diagonally, from the point of the haunch to the root of the tail. Sometimes, however, the saddle only consists of the lumbar portion of the back, and, in this case, the ribs are cut up to be cooked as cutlets."

The terrine should first be lined with slices of bacon, whereupon it is garnished like the pie with alternate layers of forcemeat, bacon strips, hares' fillets, and truffles.

Put the lid on the terrine, place it in a saucepan containing a little water, and set it to cook in the oven. The time allowed for cooking is naturally subject to the size of the terrine. It is known to be quite cooked when the grease which rises to the surface is quite clear. As long as this grease is turbid, raw juices are still issuing from the forcemeat and the garnish inside. Another method of telling is by the insertion of a needle. If the latter with- draws evenly heated throughout its length, the terrine is cooked. If the patty is to be served immediately, add some aspic to it when it is just tepid, and set it to cool under slight pressure. When quite cold, clear it of grease; trim its surface, and cut it up in the utensil. If it is to be served whole and presented, set it to cool under greater pressure ; turn it out, and trim it all round.

        "instructions": "Feathered game comprises all esculent birds that live in freedom. The number of species involved, therefore, is considerable, but from the culinary standpoint they may be grouped into ten principal classes, which are : — 1. The various pheasants, grey and red partridges, the Te- tras Californias. 2. The hazel-hen, grouse, prairie fowls, ganga, sand-grouse, 3. The various wild ducks and teals. 4. The woodcocks and snipes. 5. The various plovers, lapwings, sandpipers, water-rails, water-hens. 6. The quails, land-rails, Virginia quails. 7. The various thrushes, Corsican blackbirds. 8. The various larks. 9. The warblers. 10. The ortolans. The birds of Classes i and 4 are better high — that is to say, they should be hung for a few days, before being plucked, in a moderate draught, that they may begin to decompose, and that the particular flavour of their flesh may be accentuated, a process which increases their culinary value. Whatever opinion may be held in regard to the gaminess of these birds, one thing is quite certain — namely, that the meat of a fresh pheasant and that of a high one are two totally different things. When fresh, the meat is flavourless, whereas when it is reason- ably high it is tender, full of taste, and of an incomparable flavour. Formerly, it was the custom to lard the birds of Class i, especially when they were to be roasted. But this practice should be resolutely discarded, for, if the bird be young, it can only impair the latter's flavour, and, if it be old, it cannot possibly restore those qualities to it which it has already lost. P P 2 Besides, an old bird should never be served; it ought only to be used in the preparation of game stock or forcemeats. The birds belonging to the remaining classes are prepared fresh ; or, if it be thought necessary to let them hang for a few days, at least they should not be allowed to get high, more particularly the aquatic ones, because gaminess is, if anything, deleterious to the flavour of their flesh."

        "title": "FAISAN A LA MODE D' ALCANTARA",
        "instructions": "This recipe comes from the famous Alcantara convent. His- tory tells us that at the beginning of the Portuguese campaign in 1807 the convent's library was pillaged by Junot's soldiers, and its precious manuscripts were used in the making of cart- ridges. Now it happened that an officer of the commissariat who was witnessing the event found, among a collection of recipes selected by the monks, the particular one now under our notice, which was applied only to partridges. It struck him as interesting, and after trying it when he re- turned to France in the following year, he surrendered it to the Duchess of Abrantes, who noted it in her memoirs. It represents, perhaps, the only good thing the French derived from that unfortunate campaign, and it would tend to prove that foie gras and truffles, which had been known for so long in Languedoc and Gascony, were also known in Estre- madura, where, even at the present day, tolerably good truffles are to be found. The procedure is as follows : — Empty the pheasant from the front ; bone its breast, and stuff it with fine ducks' foies gras, mixed with quartered truffles, cooked in port wine. Marinade the pheasant for three days in port wine, taking care that it be well covered therewith. This done, cook it \" en casserole \" (the original recipe says on the spit, but the sauce- pan is more suitable). Reduce the port wine of the marinade; add to it a dozen medium-sized truffles; set the pheasant on these truffles, and heat for a further ten minutes. GAME 581 N.B. — This last part of the recipe may be advantageously replaced by the \"k la Souvaroff \" treatment — that is to say, having placed the pheasant and the truffles in a terrine, sprinkle them with the reduced port combined with slightly buttered game glaze; then hermetically seal down the lid of the terrine, and complete the cooking in the oven."

But the Salmis given above may always be included in any menu, however sumptuous. It is applied more particularly to game of the ist and 2nd classes, which should be somewhat high when treated. The recipe I give may be applied to all the birds in the two classes referred to. Roast the pheasant, keeping it moderately underdone. Quickly cut it into eight pieces, thus : two legs, two wings (separated from the pinions), and the breast cut into four length- wise. Skin the pieces; trim them neatly, and keep them at a temperate heat in a covered vegetable-pan, with a few drops of burnt brandy and a little clear melted meat glaze. Pound the carcass and the trimmings, and add to them half a bottleful of red wine (almost entirely reduced), three chopped shallots and a few mignonette pepper. Add one-quarter pint of good game Espagnole sauce; cook for ten minutes; rub through a sieve, pressing well the while, and then strain through a strainer. Reduce this sauce to about one-third, and despumate it; strain it once more through a close strainer ; add a small quan- tity of butter, and pour it over the pieces of pheasant, to which add a fine, sliced truffle and six grooved mushroom-heads. I advise the discarding of the old method of dishing upon a cushion of bread fried in butter, as also of the triangular croutons fried in butter and coated with gratin forcemeat, which usually accompanied the Salmis. A speedy preparation and a simple method of dishing, which facilitate the service and allow of the Salmis being eaten hot, are the only necessary conditions.

Set them in a sautepan, snugly pressed one against the other, and season them with salt. Cover them with a coarse julienne of carrots, onions and celery, cooked in butter, and prepared as far as possible from new vegetables. Moisten, just enough to cover, with some succulent ambpr- coloured veal stock, gelatinous and fine; cover, boil, and then poach gently for twelve minutes. This done, add a julienne of truffles (raw if possible) which should equal only half of the vegetable julienne, and poach for a further two minutes, that the truffles may cook and the quails be done. Dish in a timbale, clear of grease, and pour the cooking- liquor and the julienne over the quails. Pilaff rice is often served with quails prepared in this way."

Re- cipes may be consummate in detail and in accuracy, and Still they will be found wanting in the matter of Roasts; for ex- perience alone can tell the operator whether the joint he is treating be old or young, fresh or stale; whether it must be cooked quickly or slowly, and all the theories that I might advance on this subject, though perhaps they might not be useless, would at least prove impracticable nine times out of ten. I shall not prescribe any limit of time for Roasts, except in very special cases, and even so that limit will only be approxi- mate. Nothing can be made precise in the matter; long practice alone, away from books, will teach it ; for book-rules can only be understood when the light of practical knowledge is focussed upon them. 15e42— ACCOMPANlMENt OF ROASTS It struck me as desirable that I should give in this chapter the recipes of the various preparations which, in England, are served with Roasts : — Yorkshire Pudding, Veal Stuffing, &c.
