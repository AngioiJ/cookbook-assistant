        "instructions": "In the matter of hors-d'oeuvres, the two above names have the same meaning. The preparation consists of small slices of the crumb of bread, about one-quarter inch thick, slightly toasted and with a garnish on one of their sides. The garnish is subject to the taste of the consumer, the resources at the disposal of the cook, or the latter's fancy, which may here be fully indulged. But the garnish, par excellence, for Canapes or Toast, is fresh butter combined with a fine mince of white roast chicken- meat, the meat of shell-fish or fish, or cheese, &c., as I pointed out above under the butters for hors-d'oeuvres. Whatever be the garnish of Canapes or Toast, and even when it would be unreasonable to let butter form a part of it, as, for example, in the case of marinaded fish, anchovies, filleted herring, &c., it is always best to put plenty of butter on the pieces of toast while they are still hot, with the view of keeping them soft. When the garnish consists of a puree, i.e., a compound butter, I should advise the use of a piping-bag fitted with a grooved pipe, for laying the preparation upon the toast. This method is both clean and expeditious, and lends itself to any fanciful arrangement which the varying shape of the toast may suggest. The principal shapes given to the toast are as follows : round, square, rectangular, oval, triangular, crescented, star- like, crossed, &c. They should never exceed one and one-half inches in diameter, and a corresponding size in the other shapes. I shall only indicate here a few kinds of specially gar- nished toast, and leave the thousand and one other kinds for the operator himself to discover."

When cooled, trim them properly, dry them tho- roughly in a piece of fine linen, and steep them, one after the other, in a chaud-froid sauce of fish with paprika, the tint of which should be golden. This done, arrange the treated legs on a layer of champagne jelly, which should have set beforehand on the bottom of a square, silver dish or crystal bowl. Now lay some chervil pluches and tarragon leaves between the legs in imitation of water-grasses, and cover the whole with champagne jelly to counterfeit the effect of water.

Before serving them, it is only needful to skin them, whereupon they may be dished up with a little chopped parsley. Send a bowl of French beans to the table with them, the vegetables having been freshly cooked, kept somewhat firm, buttered, and not cooled.

Oysters are the dish par excellence; their delicacy satisfies the most fastidious of epicures, and they are so easily digested that the most delicate invalid can partake of them freely. With the exception of caviare, they are the only hors-d'oeuvres which should ever appear on the menu of a well-ordered dinner. Oysters ought to be served very cold; hence the prevailing custom of dishing them on ice. In England they are served plain on the flat half of the shell, whereas in France and else- where they are left in the hollow half, which is better calculated to retain the natural liquor of the oyster, held in high esteem by many. Send some slices of brown bread and butter to the table with the oysters. The various methods of treating oysters will be given here- after in the chapter dealing with fish.

In the centre of each roundel make a little rosette of butter, by means of a small, grooved pipe. Different butters, such as the Shrimp, Montpellier, Caviare, and other kinds, may be used with the view of varying the colours. Halved, Stuffed Eggs. — Take some very small, hard-boiled eggs; cut them into two, lengthwise; remove the yolk's, and trim the oval hollow of each of the remaining whites to the shape of an oblong, the edges of which may then be indented. Garnish, either with a puree of tunny, salmon, milt, &c., or a hash or salpicon of lobster, shrimp, &c., thickened by means of a mayonnaise with jelly, or a fine viacedoine of vege- tables with mayonnaise, or a puree composed of the withdrawn yolks combined with a little butter, some cold Bechamel sauce, and herbs. Quartered, Stuffed Eggs. — The simplest way of doing this is to proceed as above, to stuff the halved white with a buttered puree, or a puree mixed with jelly, to leave the stuffing to set, and then to cut the halves in two.

The garnishes suitable for tartlets are likewise used with barquettes, the latter only differing from the former in their shape. The directions which follow below, and which should be carefully noted, apply equally to both. HORS-D'CEUVRES i6i Special Paste jor Tartlets and Barquettes. — Sift one lb. of flour on to a mixing-board; make a hole in the centre, into which put one-eighth oz. of salt, one-half lb. of cold, melted butter, one egg, the yolks of two, and a few drops of water. Mix the whole into a paste, handling it as little as possible; roll it into a ball, and put it aside in the cool for two hours. The Preparation of Tartlet- and Barquette-crusts. — Roll out the paste to the thickness of one-eighth inch, and stamp it with an indented fancy-cutter into pieces of the same size as the tartlet-moulds to be used, which in this case are the same as for \" petits fours,\" and, therefore, very small. The fancy-cutter should be round for tartlets, and oval for barquettes. Lay the paste in the moulds, prick the parts lying on the bottom, lest they should blister, garnish the insides with pieces of kitchen-paper to protect the paste, and fill them with rice or flour. Bake in a moderate oven; remove the rice or flour, the sole object of which was to preserve the shape of the tartlets or barquettes ; turn the latter out of their moulds, and set them to cool. The Garnishes of Tartlets and Barquettes. — These may be divided into two classes, viz., (i) those with a compound butter for base, (2) those with an aspic jelly base. The first class comprises all the garnishes I gave for Canapes and Toast, as also all those which the operator's fancy, taste, and inventiveness may devise. The second class generally consists of a layer, on the bottom, of some kind of mousse, upon which a whole piece of a different colour from the mousse is placed, and which is then coated with a very clear jelly. Example. — Garnish the bottom of a tartlet or barquette with a coating of pink, shrimp, crayfish or lobster mousse. Upon this lay a very white poached oyster, or a slice of hard-boiled egg, stamped with an indented fancy-cutter. In the centre of the yolk put a little lobster coral, and coat the whole with jelly to the level of the tartlet edges. The explanations given above warrant my refraining from a more detailed discussion of these delicate preparations. Suffi- cient has been said to allow of any operator, with a little taste and inventiveness, easily making an endless variety of com- binations."

M 2 CHAPTER XII EGGS Of all the products put into requisition by the art of cookery, not one is so fruitful of variety, so universally liked, and so complete in itself as the egg. There are very few culinary recipes that do not include eggs, either as a principal con- stituent or as an ingredient. The many and various egg-preparations constitute chiefly breakfast or luncheon dishes; nevertheless, at a Lenten dinner they rriay be served as entries with advantage, for, at a time when fish, shell-fish, and water-game are the only resources in this respect, eggs form a pleasant and welcome change."

        "title": "EQQS ON THE DISH",
        "instructions": "Eggs cooked in this way derive all their quality from the way in which the cooking process is conducted. They must be evenly cooked, on top and underneath, and should remain soft. An important condition of the process is that the eggs should be exceedingly fresh. After having heated sufficient butter in the dish to cover the whole of the bottom, break two eggs into it, baste the yolks with a little very hot butter, salt them slightly, and push them into the oven. As soon as the white of the eggs assumes a milky-white colour, they are cooked and should be withdrawn from the oven to be served imme- diately. Great attention should be bestowed upon the cooking pro- cess, a few seconds more or less than the required time being sufficient to spoil the eggs. Special care ought to be taken that they do not cook either too much or too quickly, for it should be remembered that, even were the cooking checked before the proper time, the heat of the dish does, to a certain extent, make good the deficiency. Eggs a la poele, which, in England, are called \"fried eggs,\" are a variety of eggs on the dish, very often served on toast, or accompanied by sausages or fried bacon. They are EGGS 165 cooked in an omelet-pan, trimmed neatly witli a fancy-cutter, and placed, by means of a spatula, upon the prepared toast. About one-half oz. of butter should be allowed for every two eggs, which number constitutes the working-base of the following recipes."

(i) Have ready a saute-pan containing boiling salted water (one-third oz. of salt per quart of water), slightly acidulated with vinegar. Break the eggs over that part of the water which is actually boiling. (2) In order that the eggs may poach freely, do not put more than eight or ten at a time into the same saut(e-pan ; better even poach them six at a time, for then the poaching will be effected more equally. (3) As soon as the eggs are in the water, let the latter simmer. The egg is poached when the white has enveloped the yolk, reassuming, as it were, the form of a raw egg, and when it may be touched without breaking. The usual time allowed for poaching is three minutes. (4) Withdraw the eggs by means of a slice; dip them into cold water, trim their whites, and put them back into moderately warm water until ready to serve."

Their shape is oval for poached eggs, and round for soft-boiled eggs, the latter being generally dished upright. (2) On little, oval feuilletes for poached eggs, on feuilletes in the shape of indented crowns, or in small patties for soft- boiled eggs. (3) In borders of forcemeat or other preparations, the kind of which is indicated by the name of the particular egg-prepara- tion. These borders are laid on the dish by means of a piping- bag or by hand; they are either oval or round, plain or in- dented, poached or oven-browned, according to the nature of the preparation used. (4) On tartlet-crusts which are garnished so as to be in keep- ing with the method of dressing the eggs. EGGS 169 Remarks. — (i) Poached or soft-boiled eggs, when dished upon fried rusks, feuilletes, or tartlets, should, before being placed on the latter, be covered with sauce. Also before being treated with sauce they should be well drained. (2) Having given the general outlines of the procedure, I shall now pass on to the particular recipes, stating them briefly, and reminding the reader that all of them apply equally to poached and soft-boiled eggs.

If, for a special purpose, they have to be just done, it is point- less and even harmful to boil them beyond a certain time-limit, seeing that any excess in the boiling only makes them tough, and the whites particularly so, owing to their albuminous nature. In order to boil eggs uniformly, they should be put into a colander with large holes, whereby they may be plunged at the same moment of time into the boiling water. From the time the water regains the boiling point, eight minutes should be allowed in the case of medium-sized eggs, and ten minutes in the case of larger ones; but these times should never be exceeded.

Scrambled eggs are mostly served in silver timbales, but, in certain cases, they may also be dished in special little croustades, in little receptacles made from hollowed brioches, or in tartlet- EGGS 179 crusts. Formerly, it was customary to garnish scrambled eggs served in a silver timbale with small, variously-shaped pieces of toast, or with small scraps of puff-paste, cooked without colouration, and shaped like crescents, lozenges, rings, palm- ettes, &c. This method has something to recommend it, and may always be adopted. In old cookery, scrambled eggs were sanctioned only when cooked in a bain-marie. This measure certainly ensured their being properly cooked, but it consider- ably lengthened the procedure. The latter may therefore be shortened by cooking the eggs in the usual way, i.e., in a utensil in direct contact with the fire; but in this case the heat must be moderate, in order that, the process of cooking being progressive and gradual, perfect homogeneity of the particles of the eggs (effecting the smoothness of the preparation) may result."

        "instructions": "Any fat, provided it be well purified, may be used for these eggs, but oil is the more customary frying medium. To do these eggs properly, only one should be dealt with at a time. Heat some oil in an omelet-pan until it begins to smoke slightly ; break the egg on a plate ; season it, and let it slide into the pan. Then, with a wooden spoon, quickly cover up the yolk with the solidified portions of the white, in order to keep the former soft. Drain the egg on a piece of stretched linen, and proceed in the same way with the other eggs until the required quantity has been treated."

Omelets The procedure for omelets is at once very simple and very difficult, for tastes differ considerably in respect of their pre- paration. Some like them well done, others insist upon their being just done, while there are yet others who only enjoy them when they are almost liquid. Nevertheless, the following conditions apply to all — namely, that there should be homogeneity of the egg-molecules; that the whole mass should be smooth and soft; and that it should be borne in mind that an omelet is in reality scrambled eggs enclosed in a coat composed of coagulated egg. I take as my standard an omelet consisting of three eggs, the seasoning of which comprises a small pinch of table-salt and a little pepper, and which requires one-half oz. of butter for its preparation. The quantities of garnishing ingredients given below, therefore, are based upon this standard."

If the omelet is to be garnished inside, this ought to be done at the present stage, and then the omelet should be speedily rolled up and transferred to a dish, to be finished in accordance with the nature of its designation.

Thick soups, which comprise the Purees, Veloutes, and Creams. A third class, which is independent of either of the above, inasmuch as it forms part of plain, household cookery, em- braces vegetable soups and Garbures or gratincd soups. But in important dinners — by this I mean rich dinners — only the first two classes are recognised. When a menu contains two soups, one must be clear and the other thick. If only one is to be served, it may be either clear or thick, in which case the two kinds are represented alternately at different meals. In Part I. of this work I indicated the general mode of pro- cedure for consommes and thick soups; I explained how the latter might be converted from plain purees into veloutds or creams, or from veloutes into creams ; and all that now remains is to reveal the recipes proper to each of those soups. Remarks.— In the course of the recipes for consommes, given hereafter, the use of Royales (Nos. 206 to 213) and of Quenelles, variously prepared (Nos. 193 to 195), will often be enjoined. For the preparation of these garnishes, therefore, the reader will have to refer to the numbers indicated. The quantities for the clear soups that follow are all calcu- lated to be sufficient for a standard number of six people, and the quantity of Royales is always given in so many dariole- moulds, which contain about one-eighth pint, or baba-moidds, which hold about one-fifth pint. Of course, it will be understood that the poaching need not necessarily have been effected in these moulds, for very small \"Charlotte\" moulds would do quite as well. But I had re- course to the particular utensils mentioned above, in order that there might be no sort of doubt as to the exact quantity of royale it would be necessary to prepare for any one of the soups.

        "title": "TURTLE SOUP",
        "instructions": "With the exception of a few leading London restaurants, where a large quantity of this preparation is constantly in demand, turtle soup is very rarely prepared in the kitchens of catering establishments. It is more generally obtained ready- made, either fresh or preserved, and as a rule of exceptional quality, from firms whose speciality it is to make it, and who deliver it in excellent condition. From among the London firms who have deservedly earned. a reputation for this soup, \" P6criaux \" may be quoted as one whose produce is quite irreproachable. When a comparatively small quantity of this soup is re- quired, it is best to buy it ready-made; in the event of its being desirable to prepare it oneself, the following recipe will be found the simplest and most practical for the purpose. Particulars of the Operation The Slaughtering of the Turtle. — For soup, take a turtle weighing from 120 to 180 lbs., and let it be very fleshy and full of life. To slaughter it, lay it on its back on a table, with its head hanging over the side. By means of a double butcher's hook, one spike of which is thrust into the turtle's lower jaw, -while the other suspends an adequately heavy weight, make the animal hold its head back ; then, with all possible dispatch, sever the head from the body. Now immediately hang the body over a receptacle, that the blood may be collected, and leave it thus for one and one-half or two hours. Then follows the dismemberment : — To begin with, thrust a strong knife between the carapace or upper shell and the plastron or lower shell, exactly where the two meet, and separate the one from the other. The turtle being on its back, cut all the adhering flesh from the plastron, and put the latter aside. Now cut off the flippers; remove the intestines, which throw away, and carefully collect all the green fat. Whereupon cut away the flesh adhering to the carapace; once more remove all fat, and keep both in reserve. The Treatment of the Carapace, the Plastron, and the Flippers. — The carapace and plastron, which are the outside bony framework of the turtle, constitute the only portions where- from the gelatinous flesh, used as the garnish of the soup, are obtained. Saw the carapace into six or eight pieces, and the plastron into four. Put these pieces with the flippers into boiling water or into steam, to blanch. Withdraw the flippers as soon as they are sufficiently stiff for their skin to be removed, and leave the pieces of carapace and plastron to blanch for five minutes, in order that they may admit of being scraped. Now cool the pieces of carapace and plastron and the flippers, and put them into a stewpan containing enough water to abundantly cover SOUPS 221 them. Set to boil; garnish with vegetables, as in the case of an ordinary broth, and add a small quantity of turtle herbs. Five or six hours should be allowed for the cooking of the carapace and the plastron, but the flippers, which are put to further uses in other culinary preparations, should be withdrawn at the end of five hours. When the pieces are taken from the cooking-liquor, remove all the flesh from the bones, and cool the former; then trim it carefully, and cut it into little squares of one and one-half inches side. It is these squares together with the green fat (poached in salted water and sliced) which constitute the garnish of the soup. The Preparation of Turtle Soup. — There are two modes of procedure, though their respective results are almost identical. 1. Make a broth of the flesh of turtle alone, and then add a very gelatinous beef consomme to it, in pursuance of the method employed when the turtle soup is bought ready-made. This procedure is practically the best, more particularly if the soup has to be kept some time. 2. Make an ordinary broth of shin of beef, using the same quantity of the latter as of turtle. Also include half a calf's foot and one-half lb. of calf's shin per 3 lbs. of the beef. Add the flesh of the turtle, or, in the event of its being thought necessary to clarify, which operation I do not in the least advise, reserve it for that purpose. The condiments and aromatics being the same for both methods, I shall now describe the procedure for method No. i. The Ingredients of the Soup. — Put into a stewpan of con- venient size the flesh of the turtle and its head and bones. Moisten partly with the cooking-liquor of the carapace, and complete the moistening, in the case of a turtle weighing 120 lbs., with enough water to bring the whole to 50 quarts. By this means a soup of about thirty to thirty-five quarts will be obtained at the end of the operation. Add salt in the proportion of one oz. per every five quarts; set to boil; skim, and garnish with twelve carrots, a bunch of leeks (about ten bound with a head of celery), one lb. of parsley stalks, eight onions with ten cloves stuck into them, two lbs. of shallots, and one head of garlic. Set to boil gently for eight hours. An hour before straining the soup, add to the garnish four strips of lemon-peel, a bunch of herbs for turtle, comprising sweet basil, sweet marjoram, sage, rosemary, savory, and thyme, and a bag containing four oz. of coriander and two oz. of pepper- corns. Finally, strain the soup through a napkin; add the pieces of flesh from the carapace and plastron which were put aside for the garnish, and keep it until wanted in specially-made sandstone jars. The Serving of the Soup. — When about to serve this soup, heat it; test and rectify its seasoning, and finish it off by means of a port wine glass of very old Madeira to every quart. Very often a milk punch is served wkh turtle soup, the recipe being : — Milk Punch. — Prepare a syrup from one-half pint of water and three and one-half oz. of sugar, the consistence at the boil being 17° (Baume's Hydrometer). Set to infuse in this syrup two orange and two lemon zests. Strain at the end of ten minutes, and add one-half pint of rum, one-fifth pint of kirsch, two-thirds pint of milk, and the juice of three oranges and three lemons. Mix thoroughly. Let it stand for three hours; filter, and serve cold. 6 15- CONSOMME TOSCA Have ready one quart of chicken consomm6 thickened with three tablespoon fu Is of poached tapioca strained through linen. Also prepare two tablespoonfuls of a julienne of carrots stewed in butter, the cooking of which is completed in the con- somme ; ten small quenelles of chicken forcemeat, combined, in the proportion of one-third, with foie gras and chopped truffles ; ten small, very crisp profiterolles, stuffed with a puree of chicken with pistachio kernels. Put the quenelles and the julienne into the soup-tureen, pour therein the boiling consomme, and send the profiterolles to the table separately, and very hot."

Special Cold Consomm6 for Suppers Remarks Relative to the Consommes. — I gave the recipes of these consommes in Part I. of this work (No. 6), and shall now, therefore, limit myself to the following remarks, which are of paramount importance : — 1. These consommes must be perfect in limpidness and quality. 2. The flavour which typifies them should be at once decided and yet not too pronounced. 3. When the flavour is imparted by a wine, the latter should be of the best possible quality. Rather than make use of in- ferior wines, the presence of which in the soup would tend to depreciate its quality, completely discard wine flavourings. 4. Supper consommes never contain any garnish."

THICK SOUPS In Part I., Chapter I., of this work I pointed out what thick soups consist of.

The principles governing these altera- tions are very simple, and after a moment's reflection the operator will thoroughly grasp their import. Be this as it may, the reader will find the necessary directions at the end of each recipe that admits of various methods of preparation. With regard to those recipes which are not followed by any directions of the sort referred to, and which I simply class under the name of Potages, these are unalterable preparations which may only be served in accordance with the directions given. This being clear, the reader will understand that I have refrained from repeating the quantities of butter, cream, thickening ingredients, &c., in each recipe. These particulars having been given in Part I., it will be necessary to refer to that part of the book for them."

Prepare a white roux from one oz. of butter and one and one-sixth oz. of flour per quart of the moistening. Dilute with some very strong clear consomme, thoroughly cleared of grease ; boil, and despumate for one and one-half hours, adding meanwhile half as much consomme as served in the moistening of the velout6. When the veloute is thoroughly despumated and entirely cleared of grease, strain it through a silk sieve, and add, per quart, one-quarter pint of very fresh thin cream. Cool, stirring incessantly the while; once more strain the veloute through the sieve when it is cold, and, if necessary, add some of the consomme already used, in order to give the veloute the con- sistence of a thickened consomme. Serve it in cups, and see that it be sufficiently thin to not impaste the mouth of the consumer. This veloute is usually served as it stands, but it allows of various condimentary adjuncts. Such are : — Tomato and cap- sicum essences; crayfish, shrimp, or game creams. These creams or essences should be of consummate delicacy, and ought to lend only a very delicate flavour to the veloute."

Remarks concerning the Possible Variation of this Soup, — The mode of procedure adopted in the case of the Germiny could, if necessary, be appUed to all thick soups, and it would then constitute a class to which the term \" Cream \" would be better suited than it is at present to the soups thus designated. Instead of the ordinary white consomme, which is used in its preparation, a consomm6 may be used in which such vege- tables as carrots, turnips, peas, &c., are cooked, the latter being reserved for the garnish, while the cooking-liquor is thickened with egg-yolks and cream in accordance with the quantities and directions given in the above recipe. A carrot cream, a cream of fresh peas, or of asparagus-heads, prepared in this way, would be much more delicate than those prepared after the ordinary recipes. The essential point in this series of soups is the leason ; this should consist of enough egg-yolks to render the preparations sufficiently thick and creamy."

S 2 CHAPTER XIV FISH In matters culinary, fish comprise not only the vertebrates of the sea and river, but also the esculent Crustacea, mollusca, and chelonia, and one batrachian. Of course, the animals representing these various classes differ enormously in respect of their importance as articles of diet. Fresh-water fish, for in- stance, with the exception of salmon and some kinds of trout, are scarcely ever eaten in England; and the same applies to the frog. As regards salt-water fish, although certain species, such as the sole and the turbot, are in great demand, many other and excellent ones which are looked upon as inferior are seldom put into requisition by first-class cookery. Thus, Brill, Fed Mull&t, and Bass are not nearly so popular as they de- serve to be, and never appear on a menu of any importance. No doubt. Fashion — ever illogical and wayward — exercises her tyrannical sway here, as in other matters of opinion ; for it will be found, even when the distinctions among fish are once established, that there exist a host of incongruities in the un- written law. Fresh cod is a case in point; should this fish appear on the menu of a grand dinner given by Royalty, the guests would not think it at all out of place; but if the chef of a large modern hotel ventured to include it among the items of a plain table-d'hote dinner he would most probably incur the scorn and indignation of his clientele. This example, than which none could be better suited to our case, successfully shows that the culinary value of the fish has far less to do with the vogue the latter enjoys than the very often freakish whims of the public. One can but deplore the arbitrary proscription which so materially reduces the resources at the disposal of a cook, more particularly at a time when the universally imperious cry is for novelty and variety in dishes and menus respectively; and one can only hope that reason and good sense may, at no remote period, intervene to check the purposeless demands of both entertainers and their guests in this respect. FISH 261 Having regard to these considerations, I have omitted from this work, which is really a thesaurus of selected recipes and not a complete formulary, all those fish enumerated below, which are very rarely eaten in England, and the recipes for which could therefore serve no purpose : — 753 — SHADJchiefly served grilled. 754 — FRESH ANCHOVIES, extremely rare, and may be grilled or fried. 755 — EELS, considered as common, and principally used in the preparation of a pie held in high esteem by the frequenters of coffee-shops along the banks of the Thames. Small eels are also fried. eBut the many ways of dressing them which are common on the Continent are seldom practised in England. 756 — PIKE, plentiful and of excellent quality ; only used in the preparation of forcemeat and quenelles ; the directions for the latter will be given later. Albeit they are sometimes served crimped, or cooked whole in a court-bouillon au bleu, accompanied by parsley or caper sauce, &c. Small pike are generally prepared \" a la Meuniere,\" or fried. 757 — CARP, in still less demand than the pike, and only prized for its milt. It must, however, be admitted that in England, more than anywhere else, I believe, this fish is too often spoilt by the taint of mud. 758 — DORADO, served boiled with any of the English fish sauces ; but, in my opinion, it is best grilled, after the manner generally adopted in the South of France. 759 — STURGEON, very rare ; it is braised, like veal. j5o — FERA, very scarce on the market ; comes from the Swiss or Savoy lakes, and is only served 4 la Meuniere. 761 — GUDGEON, very abundant in all rivers, but never eaten. 762 — FROGS, the pet abomination of all classes of the popula- tion, with but few exceptions ; nevertheless \" Nymphes k I'Aurore,\" the recipe of which I gave among the hors-d'oeuvres, are generally appreciated."

        "title": "THE BOILING OF FISH IN SALTED WATER",
        "instructions": "The procedure changes according as to whether the fish is to be cooked whole or in slices. If whole, after having pro- FISH 263 perly cleaned, washed, and trimmed it, lay it on the drainer of the utensil best suited to its shape; i.e., a fish-kettle. Cover it with water, salt it in the proportion of one-quarter oz. of salt per quart of water, cover the utensil, and bring the liquid to the boil. As soon as this is done skim and move the kettle to the side of the fire, where the cooking of the fish may be com- pleted without boiling. If the fish is cut into slices, plunge these, which should never be cut too thin, into boiling salted water, and move the fish-kettle containing them to the side of the fire; complete their cooking slowly without allowing the water to boil. The object of this process is to concentrate, inside the fish, all the juices contained in its flesh, whereof a large portion escapes when the cut fish is plunged in cold water gradually brought to the boil. If this method is not applied to large fish, cooked whole, the reason is that the sudden immersion of these in boiling water would cause such a shrinking of their flesh that they would burst and thereby be spoiled. In the case of certain kinds of fish, such as Turbot and Brill, milk is added to the water in the proportion of one-eighth of the latter, the object being to increase the whiteness of the fish.. For the various kinds of Salmon and Trout, the court- bouillon (No. 163) is used in the place of salted water, but the general working process remains the same. The boiled fish is dished on a napkin and drainer; it is garnished with fresh parsley; and the sauce announced on the menu, together with some plain-boiled and floury potatoes, is sent to the table separately. 777-THE FRYING OF FISH In Part I. of this work I explained the general theory of frying (Chapter X., No. 26a) ; I shall now, therefore, only con- cern myself with the details of the operation in its relation to fish. As a rule, frying should never be resorted to for very large fish or very thick slices of the latter, for, owing to the very high temperature that the operation enjoins, the outside of the fish would be dried up before the inside had even become affected. If the fish to be fried is somewhat thick, it is best to cut several gashes in it, lengthwise and across, these being deeper and closer together the thicker the fish may be. The object of this measure is to facilitate the cooking, but the measure itself is quite unnecessary when dealing with small fish. In the case of flat-fish, partly detach the two underlying fillets on either side of the back-bone instead of gashing them. All fish intended for frying (except Blanchailles and White- bait) should first be steeped in salted milk, then rolled in flour before being plunged into the hot fat. If they be \" panes a I'anglaise,\" however, as they generally are in England, the milk may be dispensed with, in which case, after they have been lightly coated with flour, they are completely dipped in an anglaise (No. 174) and afterwards rolled in white bread- crumbs. They should then be patted with the blade of a knife so as to ensure the cohesion of the whole coating, and, finally, the latter should be criss-crossed with the back of a knife with the view of improving the appearance when fried. Fried fish are served either on a napkin, on a drainer, or on special dish-papers. They are garnished with fried parsley and properly trimmed half-lemons."

        "instructions": "This excellent mode of procedure is only suited to small fish or the slices of larger ones. Nevertheless, it may be re- sorted to for chicken-turbots, provided their weight do not exceed four lbs. The operation consists in cooking the fish (or slices or fillets of fish) in the frying-pan with very hot butter, after having seasoned them and sprinkled them with flour. If the fish are very small, ordinary butter is used; if, on the other hand, they are large, the procedure demands clarified butter. When the fish is sufficiently coloured on one side, it is turned over for the completion of the operation. This done, it is transferred, by means of a spatula, to a hot dish, whereon, after having been salted, it is sent to the table. It may be served as it is with a garnish of trimmed half- lemons. Fish prepared in this way are termed \" dores \" (gilded), \"Soles dords,\" \" Turbotins dores,\" &c., in order to distin- guish them from those prepared a la Meuniere. If the fish is announced \"a la Meuniere,\" a few drops of lemon should be sprinkled upon it ; it should be seasoned with salt and pepper, and garnished with concussed, scalded pars- ley. At the last moment a piece of butter, in proportion to the size of the fish, is put in the frying-pan, and is heated until it begins to brown slightly. This is poured over the fish imme- diately, and the latter is sent to the table at once while still FISH 265 covered by the froth resulting from the contact of the butter with the parsley."

        "title": "THE POACHING OF FISH",
        "instructions": "This method is best suited to sole, chicken-turbots, and brill, as well as to the fillets of various fish. Having laid the fish to be poached in a baking-tray or a sautepan, either of which should have been previously but- tered, season it moderately with salt and moisten with a little very white fish or mushroom fumet; very often the two latter are mixed. Cover the utensil, push it into a moderate oven, and baste from time to time, especially when a large fish is cooking. When the fish is done, drain it carefully, place it on a dish, and, as a rule, reduce the poaching-liquor and add it to the sauce. Poached fish are always served sauced; i.e., covered with the sauce which properly forms their accompani- ment. More often than not they are garnished after the manner which will be described later. I most emphatically urge : (i) the use of very little fish fumet for the poaching, but this fumet should be perfect and should, above all, not be cooked for longer than the required time; (2) that the fish be not covered with buttered paper as is often done, for nowadays a suitable paper is very rarely found. All papers found on the market are, owing to the chemical products used in their manufacture, liable to impart a more or less pun- gent smell to the objects they enclose, which in either degree would prove seriously prejudicial to the preparation. These remarks not only apply to fish, but to all those objects with which paper was formerly used at some stage in their cooking process."

        "instructions": "This method is generally applied to whole or sliced salmon, to trout, and to chicken-turbot. Sometimes the fish treated in this way is larded on one side with strips of bacon-fat, truffles, gherkins, or carrots. The mode of procedure is exactly the same as that described under the \" Braising of White Meats \" (No. 248). Moisten these braisings in the proportion of one- half with white wine or red wine (according as to how the fish is to be served), and for the other half use a light fish fumet. Place the fish on the drainer of a fish-kettle just large enough to hold the former, and moisten in such wise that the cooking- liquor at the beginning of the operation does not cover more than three-quarters of the depth of the fish. Unless it be for a Lenten dish, the fish may be covered with slices of bacon while cooking. In any case, baste it often. Talie care not to close the lid down too tightly, in order that the liquor may be reduced simultaneously with the cooking of the fish. When the operation is almost completed, take the lid off the fish-kettle with the view of glazing the fish ; then take the former off the fire. Now withdraw the drainer with the fish upon it, and lay it athwart the top of the fish-kettle, and let it drain ; tilt the fish on to a dish, and cover the latter pending its despatch to the table.

        "instructions": "This method is best suited to' small fish, to medium-sized chicken-turbots, and to large-sectioned fish. Unless they are very small, it is best to gash both sides of fish intended for grilling; the reasons given above for this measure likewise apply here. All white and naturally dry fish should be rolled in flour and besprinkled with butter or very good oil before being placed on the grill to be exposed to the heat of the fire. The flour forms a crust around the fish, which keeps it from drying and gives it that golden colour quite peculiar to objects thus treated. Salmon, trout, red mullet, mackerel, and herrings, the flesh whereof is fatty, need not be floured, but only besprinkled with melted butter. Owing to the somewhat fragile texture of most fish, a special double gridiron is used, by means of which they may be turned without fear of damage. This gridiron is placed upon the ordinary grill. I have already given in Part I. of this work the radical principles of grilling (No. 257); to this, therefore, the reader is begged to refer. Grilled fish are served on a very hot dish, without paper or a napkin; they are garnished with fresh parsley and grooved slices of lemon. Butter k la Maitre d'Hotel, anchovy butter, devilled sauce, Roberts' sauce Escoffier, and butter k la Ravigote constitute the best adjuncts to grilled fish. FISH 267"

        "title": "THE CRIMPING OF FISH",
        "instructions": "Crimped fish is quite an English speciality. This method of preparation is applied more particularly to salmon, fresh cod, haddock, and skate. The first three of these fish may be prepared whole or in slices, while skate is always cut into more or less large pieces after it has been skinned on both sides. In order to crimp a whole fish, it should be taken as it leaves the water. Lay it on something flat, and make deep lateral gashes on both its sides from head to tail. Allow a space of about one and one-half inches to two inches between each gash. This done, put the fish to soak in very cold water for an hour or so. When the fish is to be cooked sliced, divide it up as soon as it is caught, and put the slices to soak in very cold water, as in the case of the whole fish. But does this barbarous method, which stiffens and contracts the flesh of the fish, affect its quality so materially as con- noisseurs would have us believe ? It is very difficult to say, and opinions on the matter are divided. This, however, is certain, that fish prepared in the way above described is greatly relished by many. Whether whole or sliced, crimped fish is always boiled in salted water. Its cooking presents a real difficulty, in that it must be stopped at the precise moment when it is completed, any delay in this respect proving prejudicial to the quality of the dish. Crimped fish is served like the boiled kind, and all the sauces suited to the latter likewise obtain with the former. Besides the selected sauce, send a sauceboat to the table con- taining some of the cooking-liquor of the fish. SALMON (SAUMON) Salmon caught on the Rhine, or Dutch salmon, is generally considered the most delicate that may be had, though, in my opinion, ihat obtained from certain English rivers, such, for instance, as the Severn, is by no means inferior to the fore- going. Here in England this excellent fish is held in the high esteem it deserves, and the quantity consumed in this country is considerable. It is served as plainly as possible, either boiled, cold or hot, grilled, or k la Meuniere; but whatever be the method of preparation, it is always accompanied by cucum- ber salad. The slices of salmon, however, thick or thin, large or small, take the name of \" Darnes.\""

Pieces cooked separately may seem better or may be more easily made to look sightly, but their meat is drier than that of the salmon cooked whole. And what is lost in appearance with the very large pieces is more than compensated for by their extra quality. In dishing cold salmon the skin may be removed and the fillets bared, so that the fish may be more easily decorated, but the real gourmet will always prefer the salmon served in its natural silver vestment. In decorating cold salmon use pieces of cucumber, anchovy fillets, capers, slices of tomato, curled-leaf parsley, &c. I am not partial to the decorating of salmon with softened butter, coloured or not, laid on by means of the piping-bag. Apart from the fact that this method of decoration is rarely artistic, the butter used combines badly with the cold sauces and the meat of the salmon on the diner's plate. Very green tarragon leaves, chervil, lobster coral, &c., afford a more natural and more delicate means of ornamentation. The only butter fit to be served with cold salmon is Montpellier butter (No. 153), though this, in fact, is but a cold sauce often re- sorted to for the coating of the cold fish in question. Among the garnishes which suit cold salmon, I might men- tion small peeled, and emptied tomatoes garnished with some kind of salad; hard-boiled eggs, either wholly stuffed, or stuffed in halves or in quarters, barquettes, tartlets and cassolettes made from cucumber or beetroot, parboiled until almost com- pletely cooked and garnished with a puree of tunny, of sar- dines, of anchovies, &c. ; small aspics of shrimps or of cray- fishes' tails; small slices of lobster, &c.

Send to the table, separately, a fine Bechamel sauce, com- bined with the braising-liquor of the trout, strained and re- duced, and finished with crayfish butter."

        "instructions": "This mousse, like those which I shall give later, is really a bavarois without sugar. Its recipe is exactly the same as that of the \" bavarois of fruit,\" except with regard to the question of sugar. Cook one-half lb. of tomato pulp (cleared of skin and seeds, and roughly chopped) in one oz. of butter. When the pulp has thoroughly mingled with the butter, add thereto two table- spoonfuls of veloute thickened by means of eight leaves of gelatine per quart of the sauce. Rub through tammy, and add to the preparation, when almost cold, half of its volume of barely-whipped cream. Taste the mousse ; season with a few drops of lemon juice, and if it still seems flat, add the necessary salt and a very little cayenne. N.B. — It will be seen that I prescribe cream only half- whipped. This precaution, however, does not apply to \"Mousse de Tomates \" alone, but to all mousses. Well- whipped cream imparts a dry and woolly taste to them, whereas, when it is only half-whipped, it renders them unctuous and fresh to the palate. From the point of view of delicacy, the respective results of the two methods do not bear comparison."

SOLES. Sole may be served whole or filleted, and a large number of the recipes given for the whole fish may be adapted to its fillets. As a rule, the fillets are made to appear on the menu of a dinner owing to the fact that they dish more elegantly and are more easily served than the whole fish, the latter being generally served at luncheons. Nevertheless, in cases where great ceremony is not observed at a dinner, soles may well be served whole, inasmuch as no hard-and-fast rule has ever obtained in this matter."

Trim the sole ; put it into a special, deep earthenware dish, the bottom of which should be buttered ; pour the fumet over it and poach gently. Now send it to the table with a plate containing separate heaps of one finely-chopped onion, a little powdered thyme, and three finely-crushed biscottes. In the dining-room the waiter places the dish on a chafer, and, taking off the sole, he raises the fillets therefrom, and places them between two hot plates. He then adds to the cooking-liquor of the sole the chopped onion, which he leaves to cook for a few moments, the powdered thyme and a sufficient quantity of the biscotte raspings to allow of thickening the whole. At the last minute he adds six raw oysters and one oz. of butter divided into small pieces. As soon as the oysters are stiff, he returns the fillets of sole to the dish, besprinkles them copiously with the sauce, and then serves them very hot. N.B. — In order to promote the poaching of the soles, more particularly when they are large, the fillets on the upper side of the fish should be slightly separated from the bones. By this means the heat is able to reach the inside of the fish very quickly, and the operation is accelerated. The sole is always laid on the dish with its opened side undermost — that is to say, on its back. 8 1 9— SOLE MORN AY Lay the sole on a buttered dish ; sprinkle a little fish fumet over it, and add one-half oz. of butter divided into small pieces.

FILLETS OF SOLE Subject to the kind of dish required, fillets of sole are either kept in their natural state, they are stuffed and folded over, or they are simply folded over without being stuffed, each of which methods of preparation will be specially referred to in the recipes. Whatever be the method adopted, always skin the fillets thoroughly; i.e., remove the thin membrane which lies beneath the skin, the tendency of which, during the cooking process, is to shrink and thereby disfigure the fillet. This done, flatten out the fillets with the broad side of a wet knife, and trim them slightly if necessary. The poaching of fillets of sole must be effected without allowing the cooking- liquor to boil, the object being to prevent the pieces losing their shape. Fillets should also be kept very white. In cases where the exact amount of the poaching-liquor is not given, allow one-quarter pint to every four fillets, i.e., to every sole."

The paupiettes (or fillets rolled after the manner of a scroll) are served either as entries like fillets of sole, of which they are but a special kind, or as a garnish. For the second purpose, not only should they be smaller than for the first, but very small fillets are generally selected for the preparation of the paupiettes. In order to make paupiettes, first remove the horny film from the outside surfaces of the fillets, and then slightly flatten the latter with the blade of a large knife ; trim them on both sides, and coat them on their flayed side with a thin layer of fish force- meat, truffled or not, in accordance with the requirements. t?ISH 307 Now roll them into scroll-form ; smooth the forcemeat that projects from the top end, and the paupieltes are done. Stand them upright in a buttered sautepan to poach, and take care to place them snugly together lest they lose their shape while the operation is in progress. Moisten them with sufficient fish fumet (No. 11) to cover them; poach them in a moderate oven, and remember, as in the case of fillets of sole, not to let the poaching-liquor boil. All the garnishes and sauces suited to fillets of sole likewise obtain with paupiettes, provided the difference in their shape be taken into account when dishing up. For salmon paupiettes, cut slices two-thirds inch wide, one- half inch thick, and the length of a fillet of sole, from a skinned fillet of salmon. In view of the unusual fragility of salmon's flesh, the slices of fillets should be carefully flattened in order to give them the width and thickness of a fillet of sole.

        "instructions": "An essential point in the making of an aspic is the clearness of the fish jelly. For a sole aspic, take some white fish aspic, which is at once succulent, limpid, and just sufficiently viscous to allow of its being turned out of a mould without breaking. For the purpose under consideration, moulds with plain or decorated borders are generally used, and there are two modes of procedure : — I. For a mould capable of holding one quart, fold twelve small fillets of sole and poach them in butter and lemon juice, taking care to keep them very white. This done, set them to cool under a light weight. Pour a few tablespoonfuls of melted fish jelly into the mould, which should be lying amidst broken ice. As soon as the jelly begins to set, decorate it tastefully with pieces (lozenges, cres- cents, &c.) of very black truffle and the poached white of an egg. Capers, tarragon leaves, thin roundels of small radishes, &c., may also be used for the purpose of decoration. When this part of the procedure has been satisfactorily effected, sprinkle a few drops of the same jelly over the decorat- ing particles, in order to fix them and prevent their shifting during the subsequent stages of the process. Now add enough melted jelly to cover the bottom of the mould with a layer one inch thick, and leave this to set. X 2 3d8 guide to modern COOKERY On this set jelly, arrange the six fillets of sole ; let their tail- ends overlap, and cover them with jelly. Continue adding coat upon coat of jelly until the thickness covering the fillets measures about one-half inch. Now arrange the remaining fillets in the reverse order, and fill up the mould with cold, melted jelly. Leave to cool for one hour. When about to serve, quickly dip the mould in a saucepan of hot water; wipe it, and turn out the aspic upon a folded napkin lying on a dish."

All fish sauces may be served with turbot. When, for the sake of variety, or in pursuance of the consumer's wishes, turbot has to be braised or garnished, it is best to select a medium- FISH 311 sized fish, i.e., one weighing from eight to twelve lbs., thick, very fleshy, and white. Unless expressly ordered, it is best to avoid surrounding the piece with its garnish. Preferably, send the latter to the table in a separate dish, as also the sauce. By this means the service is expedited, and, more important still, the fish is quite hot when it reaches the table. It is granted that the sight of a dish containing a fine, richly garnished and taste- fully arranged piece is flattering to the host, but it would be a pity that the quality of the fish should thereby sufifer, more particularly as the gourmet is not satisfied with sightliness alone. I explained at the beginning of this chapter, under \" Boiled Fish \" (No. 776 and 779), the details relating to this method of cooking, especially with regard to its application to turbot. For the braising and garnishing of turbot, the reader is begged to refer to the recipes concerned with chicken-turbot. These recipes may be applied to turbot, provided the difference in the size of the fish be taken into account in reference to the time allowed for braising and the quantities of the garnishing ingredients."

It will be found that turbot, especially when sliced, tends to harden, crumple, and lose its flavour while cooling. It is there- fore of the greatest importance that the fish should have just cooled after cooking, and that the cooking-liquor should have barely time to set; otherwise the evil effects of cooling, men- tioned above, will surely ensue. When served, just cooled, with one of the cold sauces suited to fish, turbot can vie in delicacy even with such fish as salmon or trout, which are usually served cold."

The object of this measure is to prevent the forcemeat from spilling during the poaching. Lay the two garnished carapaces on a tray containing just enough boiling water to moisten its whole surface. Put the tray in a moderate oven or in a steamer, and allow from fifteen to twenty minutes for the souffle to poach. This done, carefully drain the two carapaces; remove the paper holding in the forcemeat; dish them on a napkin, and surround them with bunches of very green, curled-leaf parsley. Serve separately a sauce in keeping with the preparation ; i.e., a Normande, a White-wine, a Diplomate, or a Bechamel finished with lobster butter, &c. N.B. — The above constitutes the model-recipe of lobster souffle, and I need scarcely point out that the latter may be varied almost indefinitely in accordance with the fancy of the cook and the taste of the consumer. Thus the forcemeat may be garnished with truffles in dice, slices of lobster, milt, or poached oysters, &c., which garnishes may also be laid on the souffle when it is finished.

        "instructions": "When the mousse is intended for moulding, it is well to decorate and \" clothe \" the mould with fish jelly some time in advance. I have already explained that to \" clothe \" a mould with jelly, all that is needed is to pour therein a few table- spoonfuls of melted jelly, and then to rock the utensil on ice. By this means a thin even coating sets on the bottom and sides of the mould, which, when the moulding is turned out, swathes the latter in a transparent film. This \" clothing \" of jelly may be made more or less thick, according to the requirements, by simply using more or less jelly, and by proportionately lengthening or shortening the time for rocking the mould. When the mould is clothed, decorate the sides with large slices of very black truffle dipped in melted jelly, that they may stick. This done, fill the receptacle with the prepared mousse (see the preceding recipe), and leave to set in the cool. For the turning out of the mould and the dishing of the moulding, proceed as for the aspic."

The aperture left by the removed strip of shell ought to be sufficiently wide to allow of the meat of the tail being removed without breaking it.

Cut the meat of the tail into even collops, and lay on each a roundel of truffle stamped out with the fancy-cutter, and dipped in half-melted jelly. Then coat these slices, which should be on a dish, again and again, with cold melted jelly until they are well covered with it.

This is doubtless accounted for by the fact that ladies, dining in evening dress, find them somewhat difficult to manage. They are therefore only served in the form of an aspic, a mousse, mousselines, timbales, &c., or as the garnish of some other fish ; for in all these cases they are shelled. Be all this as it may, I give below the various recipes re- lating to them, and from among these it ought to be possible to choose one which will meet the requirements of any particular case. 966 ECREVISSES A LA BORDELAISE N.B. — Whatever be their _mode of preparation, crayfish should always be thoroughly cleansed and cleared of their in- testines, the extreme end of which is to be found under the middle of the tail. In order to remove the intestines, take the telson or tail-segment between the point of a small knife and the thumb, and pull gently. If this were not done, the in- testines, especially in the breeding season, might render the crayfish disagreeably bitter. As soon as their intestines have been removed, the crayfish should be set to cook, otherwise, i.e., if they be left to wait, their juices escape through the anal wound, and they empty. For twelve crayfish, after having cleaned and eviscerated them, put them into a vegetable-pan with one tablespoonful of very fine mirepoix, completely cooked beforehand, and two- thirds oz. of butter. Toss them over an open fire until the shells have acquired a fine, red colour. Moisten with three tablespoonfuls of burnt brandy and one-quarter pint of white wine; reduce by a third, and complete with one tablespoonful of Espagnole, two tablespoonfuls of fish fumet, the same quan- tity of tomato puree, and one spoonful of special mirepoix (No. 229). Put the lid on, and set to cook for ten minutes. Dish the crayfish in a timbale ; reduce the sauce by a quarter, and finish it with a few drops of meat glaze, one oz. of butter, a very little cayenne, chopped chervil, and tarragon.

The object of this disproportion has already been explained under \" Veloute d'Eperlans \" (No. 680). The flesh of the smelt is of a much too decided flavour to be used alone, and when this flavour dominates, it becomes positively disagreeable ; hence the need of a fish whose flesh is almost neutral in so far as taste is concerned. But this addition of a fish foreign to the base of the preparation fulfils a double purpose; for, while it effectually weakens the pungency of the smelt's flesh, it also enables the whole preparation to absorb a much larger quantity of cream, and this last circumstance can only allow of the mousselines being lighter and mellower."

Cover the bottom of the mould with a round piece of buttered kitchen paper, and do the same on the sides. Prepare the required quantity of smelts' fillets; slightly flatten them in order to break their fibres, and trim them all to the same length and width. z 2 Then garnish the bottom of the mould with tlie fillets of smelt, placing them so that their skin-sides are against the mould. Between each of the fillets set a small strip of truffle, one quarter of the width of the former. Garnish the sides in the same way, putting a strip of truffle between each; but take care to place the fillets aslant instead of upright. Having thus lined the mould with fillets of smelt and truffle, cover the whole with a layer of mousseline force- meat, one-half inch thick. Now fill the mould in the following way : — On the layer of forcemeat covering the fillets at the bottom of the mould set as many slices of truffle as will cover it; spread another layer of forcemeat on the truffle, and over that lay, alternately, a sufficient quantity of fillets of smelt and anchovy. Follow with a fresh layer of forcemeat, slices of truffle, &c., until the mould is full, and finish with a layer of forcemeat. Poach the motisse (covered) in a moderate oven, and allow fifty minutes for one prepared in a quart-mould. It is very easy, however, to tell when the mousse is done, by simply thrusting a small knife into it; if the blade of the knife with- draws quite clean, the mousse is cooked.

        "title": "CHAR (Ombre-Chevalier)",
        "instructions": "The char is a fish of the salmon family, which is culinarily treated in exactly the same way as the trout. When it is large, the recipes given for salmon trout may be adapted to it, but it is mostly used small — that is to say, from five inches to ten inches long. The fishing of char is restricted chiefly to lake countries, such as Scotland and Switzerland, and it is only in season during two months of the year. More- over, as this fish loses much of its quality in transit, its scarcity on the market will be easily understood. The lake of Zug, in Switzerland, supplies the most famous specimens, which are called Rothel by the people of the locality. The delicacy of the fish is remarkable, and in this it may vie even with the best river trout. The char of the Scotch lakes may be treated after the same recipes as the Swiss specimens, but they are more often used in the preparation of potted char, the recipe for which is as follows : —"

        "title": "POTTED CHAR",
        "instructions": "Cook the chars in a fine mirepoix with white wine, exactly after the manner of trout. When the fish are cooked, leave them to cool completely in their cooking-liquor. Drain them ; skin them; separate their fillets, and thoroughly bone them. Set the fillets in a special earthenware pot; entirely cover them with clarified butter, and put them in a moderate oven for one quarter of an hour. Leave them to cool until the next day, and add sufficient clarified butter to cover them with a layer one-third inch thick. If Potted Char be left in the cool, it will keep for some considerable time. RED MULLETS (ROUGETS) Red mullet, especially the Mediterranean rock kind, is one of the greatest fish delicacies known ; and the surname ' ' Sea Woodcock,\" which gourmets sometimes give it, is quite justi- fied, not only by its quality, but by the fact that, except for its gills, it is generally left whole, and not even emptied. It is best grilled. io3Sa— GRILLED RED MULLET Carefully wipe the mullet; cisel it on either side to a depth in proportion to the thickness of its flesh and at closer intervals the thicker the latter is, in order to facilitate the cooking ; season it with salt and pepper ; sprinkle it with a little oil and a few drops of lemon juice; spread a few slices of lemon and a few parsley stalks upon and beneath it; and let it marinade for an hour or two, turning it over frequently the while. Twenty minutes before serving, set the red mullet on a double fish grill, and cook it over a rather fierce fire, sprinkling it often the while with its marinade. Dish and serve it as soon as it is ready, and serve a little half-melted maitre- d'hotel butter separately. 1035b— ROUQET A LA BORDELAISE Grill or saute the red mullet. At the same time serve a sauce Bordelaise Bonnefoy (No. 67). 1035c— ROUQET AU FENOUIL Cisel and marinade the red mullet as directed under No. 1035a, and add a certain quantity of chopped fennel to the aromatics. Twenty minutes before serving, add two oz. of roughly-chopped raw pork fat and a little parsley to the marinade ; wrap the red mullets in strong, oiled paper, together with its marinade, grill it gently, and serve it as it stands. io35d-ROUQET A LA NICOISE Grill it as directed above, and serve it with the garnish given under \" Sole a la Niyoise.\" 10356— ROUQET EN PAPILLOTE Grill and wrap it in strong, oiled paper between two layers of somewhat thick Duxelle sauce. When about to serve, put the papillote for five minutes in the oven, that it may be souffled."

        "title": "WHITEBAIT",
        "instructions": "Thames whitebait, which has many points in common with the \" Nonat \" of the Mediterranean, is one of the riddles of ichthyology; for, while it is generally admitted that it is the fry of one of the many species of fish, its real parentage is quite unknown. At dinners in London it usually stands as a second fish- course, and, fried after the customary manner, it constitutes a dish the delicacy of which is incomparable. Whitebait, like the nonat, are extremely fragile, and ought to be cooked as soon as they are caught. They are always served fried, and the frying-medium used in their preparation should be fresh, abundant, and just smoking when the fish are plunged into it. Previous to this operation, however, the whitebait ought to be thoroughly dredged with flour and placed in a special sieve FISH 349 or frying basket, either of which should be well shaken, in order to rid the fish of any superfluous flour. They are then plunged into the smoking frying-medium, in small quantities at a time, and one minute's stay therein suffices to render them sufficiently crisp. Draining is the next operation, effected upon a spread piece of linen, that the fish may be easily seasoned with table-salt and cayenne, mixed. This done, the whitebait are dished upon a napkin and sent to the table with very green, fried parsley. VARIOUS PREPARATIONS OF FISH"

        "instructions": "Pound separately one lb. of the meat of pike, cleared of all skin and bones, and one lb. of the fat of kidney of beef, very dry, cleaned, and cut into small pieces. If desired, half of the weight of the fat of kidney of beef may be replaced by one-half lb. of beef marrow. Put the pounded meat of the pike and the kidney fat on separate plates. Now pound one lb. of frangipane Panada (No. 192) and add thereto, little by little, the white of four little eggs. Put the pike meat and the fat back into the mortar, and finely pound the whole until a fine, smooth paste is obtained. Rub the latter through a sieve; put the resulting pur6e into a basin, and work it well with a wooden spoon in order to smooth it. With this forcemeat mould some quenelles with a spoon, and poach them in salted water. If these quenelles are to be served with an ordinary fish sauce, put them into it as soon as they are poached and drained, and simmer them in it for ten minutes that they may swell. If the sauce intended for them is to be thickened with egg- yolks, and buttered at the last moment, put them into a sauce- FISH 351 pan with a few tablespoonfuls of fumet, and simmer them as directed in the case of an ordinary fish sauce, taking care to keep the saucepan well covered that the concentrated steam may assist the swelling of the quenelles. In this case they are added to the sauce at the last moment. N.B. — Slices of truffle may always be added to the sauce. The quenelles are dished either in a silver timbale, in a shallow timbale-crust, or in a fine vol-au-vent crust, in accordance with the arrangement of the menu."

        "title": "WATERZOI",
        "instructions": "In order to prepare Waterzoi, it is best, when possible, to have live fish at one's disposal, not only because these are better able to resist the cooking process, but also owing to the fact that they are richer in gelatine in the live state. The fish more generally used are the eel, the perch, the tench, the carp, the pike, &c. After having scaled and emptied them, trim them and cut off their heads and tails. Cut the fish into sections; moisten these with just enough cold water to cover them; add a piece of butter, sufficient parsley roots or stalks to produce a decided taste, a few peppercorns, and some salt. Set to cook on a brisk fire, and take care that the cooking- liquor be reduced and sufficiently thickened when the fish are cooked. Serve in a timbale or on a dish, and send some slices of bread and butter to the table at the same time. CHAPTER XV RELEVES AND ENTREES The difference between Releves and Entries needs only to be examined very superficially in order for it to be seen how entirely the classification hangs on the question of bulk. Indeed, with very few exceptions, the same alimentary pro- ducts— butcher's meat, fish, poultry, and game — may be used with perfect propriety in the preparation of either Releves or Entries. And if the mode of preparation and the nature of the garnishing ingredients are sometimes dissimilar, it is owing to that difference in bulk referred to above, on account of which the Releves, being more voluminous, are usually braised, poeled, poached, or roasted; while the Entries, consisting of smaller pieces, are chiefly sauted, poached, or grilled. In the menus of old-fashioned dinners k la Fran9aise, the line of demarcation between Releves and Entries was far more clearly defined, the latter being generally twice, if not thrice, as numerous as the former. The first service of a dinner for twenty people, for instance, comprised eight or twelve Entries and four soups, all of which were set on the dining-table before the admission of- the diners. As soon as the soups were served, the Releves, to the number of four, two of which consisted of fish, took the place of the soups on the table; they relieved the soups; hence their name, which now, of course, is quite meaningless. The Russian method of serving greatly simplified the prac- tice just described. Nowadays a dinner rarely consists of more than two soups, two Relevds (one of which is fish), and two or three Entries for the first service. Very often the fish Relev6, instead of being a large piece of fish, only consists of fillets of sole, of chicken-turbots, &c., or timbales, which are real entries; while the Releves (consisting of large pieces of butcher's meat or game), instead of being served as common sense would dictate, i.e., after the fish Releve, when the diner's appetite is still keen, are placed, according to English custom, after the Entries."
