        "instructions": "Quantities for making Four Quarts. 3 lbs. of shin of beef. | lb. of leeks and i stick of celery. 3 lbs. of lean beef. | lb. of parsnips. 1 1 lbs. of fowls' carcases. i medium-sized onion with a I lb. of carrots. clove stuck in it. I lb. of turnips. Preparation. — Put the meat into a stock-pot of suitable dimensions, after having previously strung it together; add the poultry carcase, five quarts of water, and one-half oz. of grey salt. Place the stock-pot on a moderate fire in such a manner that it may not boil too quickly, and remember to stir the meat from time to time. Under the influence of the heat, the water gradually reaches the interior of the meat, where, after having dissolved the liquid portions, it duly com- bines with them. These liquid portions contain a large pro- portion of albumen, and as the temperature of the water rises this substance has a tendency to coagulate. It also increases in volume, and, by virtue of its lightness, escapes from the water and accumulates on the surface in the form of scum. Carefully remove this scum as it forms, and occasionally add a little cold water before the boil is reached in order that, the latter being retarded, a complete expulsion of the scum may be effected. The clearness of the consomme largely depends upon the manner in which this skimming has been carried out. Then the vegetable garnishing is added. The scum from these is removed as in the previous case, and the edge of the stock-pot should be carefully wiped to the level of the fluid, so as to free it from the deposit which has been formed there. The stock-pot is then moved to a corner of the fire where it may continue cooking slowly for four or five hours. At the end of this time it should be taken right away from the fire, and, after half a pint of cold water has been added to its con- tents, it should be left to rest a few minutes with a view to allowing the grease to accumulate on the surface of the liquid, whence it must be carefully removed before the consomme is strained. This last operation is effected by means of a very fine strainer, placed on the top of a white tureen (clean and wide), which should then be placed in a draught to hasten the cooling of the consomm6. The tureen should not on any account be covered, and this more particularly in summer, when rapid cooling is a precautionary measure against fer- mentation. Remarks upon the Different Causes which Combine to Influence the Quality of a Consomme It will be seen that I have not made any mention in the above formula of the meat and the vegetables which have helped to make the consomme, my reason being that it is preferable to remove them from the stock-pot only after the B 2 broth has been strained, so as not to run the risk of disturbing the latter. The quality of the meat goes a long way . towards settling the quality of the consomme. In order that the latter be perfect, it is essential that the meat used should be- that of comparatively old animals whose flesh is well set and rich in flavour. This is a sine qua non, and the lack of meat coming from old animals in England accounts for the difficulty attaching to the making of a good consomme and savoury sauces in this country. Cattle in England are killed at an age varying from three to four years at the most; the meat thus obtained has no equal for the purpose of roasts and grills, and anything approaching it is rarely met with on the Continent. But when this same meat is used for boiling or braising, it does not contain enough juice or flavour to yield a satisfactory result. This shortcoming is furthermore aggravated by a fault that many commit who are employed in the making of consommes and stock. The fault in question consists in cooking the bones simultaneously with the meat. Now to extract that gelatinous element from bone which produces the mellowness character- istic of all good consommes, it is necessary that the gelatigenous bodies should be cooked for twelve hours at least, and even after that time has elapsed they are still not entirely spent. On the Continent the quality of the meat easily compensates for this technical error, but such is certainly not the case in England, where five hours' stewing only results in a flat and insipid consomme. I therefore believe that, in the case of either consomme or stock, the formulas of which I shall give later, it would be ad- visable for the bones to stew at least twelve hours, and this only after they have been well broken up, while the quantity of water used should be so calculated as to suffice exactly for the im- mersion of the meat that must follow. The contents of this first stock-pot should include half of the vegetables mentioned, and the consomm6 thus obtained, after having been strained and cooled, will take the place of the water in the recipe, in accord- ance with the directions I have given above. The Uses of White Consomme ., White consomme is used in the preparation of clarified con- sommes, in which case it undergoes a process of clarifying, the directions for which will be given later. It also serves as the liquor for thick soups, poached fowls, &c. It must be limpid. as colourless as possible, and very slightly salted, for, what- ever the use may be for which it is intended, it has to undergo a process of concentration."

        "title": "THE PREPARATION OF CLARIFIED",
        "instructions": "CONSOMME FOR CLEAR SOUPS Qwantities for making four quarts. — Five quarts of ordinary consomme, one and one-half lbs. of very lean beef, the white of an egg, one fowl's carcase (roasted if possible). First, mince the beef and pound it in a mortar with the fowl's carcase and the white of egg, adding a little cold white consomme. Put the whole into a tall, narrow, and thick-bottomed stewpan ; then gradually add the cold, white broth, from which all grease has been removed, that the whole may be well mixed. Then the stewpan may be put on the fire, and its contents thoroughly stirred, for fear of their burning at the bottom. When boiling-point is reached, move the stewpan to a corner of the fire, so that the soup may only simmer, for anything approaching the boil would disturb the contents. A good hour should be enough to properly finish the consomme, and any longer time on the fire would be rather prejudicial than the reverse, as it would probably impair the flavour of the prepara- tion. Now carefully remove what little grease may have col- lected on the surface of the consomme, and strain the latter through muslin into another clean stewpan. It is now ready for the addition of the garnishes that are to form part of it, which I shall enumerate in due course. Remarks upon Clarifications For clarified consommes, even more than for the ordinary kind, it is eminently advisable that the meat should be that of old animals. Indeed, it is safe to say that one lb. of meat coming from an animal of eight years will yield much better consomme than two lbs. would, coming from a fattened animal of about three or four years. The consomme will be stronger, mellower, and certainly more tasty, as the flesh of young animals has absolutely no richness of flavour. It will be seen that I do not refer to any vegetable for the clarification. If the white consomme has been well carried out, it should be able to dispense with all supplementary flavouring, and, the customary error of cooks being rather to overdo the quantity of vegetables — even to the extent of disguising the natural aroma of the consomme — I preferred to entirely abandon the idea of vegetable garnishes in clarifications, and thus avoid a common stumbling-block."

The colour of chicken consomm6 should be lighter than that of the ordinary kind — namely, a light, amber yellow, limpid and warm. e"

        "title": "FISH CONSOMME",
        "instructions": "These consommes are rarely used, for Lenten soups with a fish basis are generally thick soups, for the preparation of which the fish fumet whereof I shall give the formula later (Formula No. ii) should avail. Whenever there is no definite reason for the use of an absolutely Lenten consomme, it would be advisable to resort to one of the ordinary kind, and to finish off the same by means of a good fish essence extracted from the bones of a sole or whiting. An excellent consomm6 is thus obtained, more palatable and less flat than the plain fish con- somme. If, however, one were obliged to make a plain fish con- somme, the following procedure should be adopted : — Clarification of Fish Consomme Quantities for making Four Quarts. — Four and one-half quarts of ordinary fish fumet having a decided taste; one-half lb. of good fresh caviare, or pressed caviare. Mode of Procedure. — Pound the caviare and mix the result- ing pulp with the cold fish fumet. Put the whole into a sauce- pan, place it on the open fire, and stir with a spatula until the contents reach the boil. Then move the saucepan to a corner of the fire, and let the consomme simmer gently for twenty minutes, after which strain it through muslin with great caution, and keep it well covered and in the warmth, so as to prevent the formation of a gelatinous film on the surface. Fish consommies are greatly improved by the addition of such ftfothatics as saffron or curry, both of which considerably add to their quahty. ' 5— GAME CONSOMME The necks, breasts, and shoulders of venison and of hare, old wild rabbits, old pheasants, and old partridges may be used in the production of game consommes. An ordinary consomme may likewise be made, in which half the beef can be replaced by veal, and to which may be added, while clarifying, a suc- culent game essence. This last method is even preferable when dealing with feathered game, but in either case it is essential that the meat used should be half-roasted beforehand, in order to strengthen the fumet. The formula that I give below must therefore only be looked upon as a model, necessarily alterable according to the resources at one's disposal, the circumstances, and the end in view. Quantities for making Four Quarts of Plain Game Consomme. 3 lbs. of neck, shoulder, or breast i medium-sized leek and 2 sticks of venison. of celery. I J lbs. of hare-trimmings. i bunch of herbs with extra I old pheasant or 2 partridges. thyme and bay leaves. 4 oz. of sliced carrots, browned in i onion, oven-browned, with 2 butter. cloves stuck into it. J lb. of mushrooms, likewise browned in butter. Liquor. — Five and one-half quarts of water. Seasoning. — One oz. of salt and a few peppercorns, these to be added ten minutes previous to straining the consomme. Time allowed for cooking. — Three hours. Mode of Procedure. — Proceed in exactly the same way as for * ordinary consommes, taking care only to half-roast the meat, as I pointed out above, before putting it in the stewpan. The Clarification of Game Consommes The constituents of the clarification of game consommes vary according to the kind of consomme desired. If it is to have a partridge flavour, one partridge should be allowed for each quart of the consomme, whereas if its flavour is to be that of the pheasant, half an old pheasant will be required per each quart of the liquid. Lastly, in the case of plain game consommes, one lb. of lean venison, hare, or wild rabbit should be allowed for each quart of the required consomm6. Mode of Procedure. — Whatever be the kind of game used, the latter must be thoroughly boned and the meat well pounded, together with the white of an egg per four quarts of consomme. About two oz. per quart of dried mushrooms should now be added if they can be procured, while the bones and the remains or carcases of game should be browned in the oven and com- pletely drained of all grease. The whole can now be mixed with the cold game consomme. The clarification is then put over an open fire (stirring incessantly the while), and as soon as the boil is reached the saucepan must be moved to a corner of the fire, where its contents niay gently boil for three-quarters of an hour. The fat should then be removed, and the con- somme strained through muslin, after which cover up until wanted."

        "title": "SPECIAL CONSOMMES FOR SUPPERS",
        "instructions": "The consommes whose formulae I have just given are in- tended more particularly for dinners. They are always finished off by some kind of garnish, which, besides lending them an additional touch of flavour, gives them their special and definite character when they are served up in the diner's plate. But the case is otherwise with the consommes served for suppers. These, being only served in cups, either hot or cold, do not allow of any garnishing, since they are to be drunk at table. They must therefore be perfect in themselves, delicate, and quite clear. These special consommes are made in a similar manner to the others, though it is needful to slightly increase the quantity of meat used for the clarification, and to add to that clarification the particular flavour mentioned on th.e menu — to wit, a few stalks of celery, if the consomme is a celery one; a small quantity of curry, if the consomm6 is given as \" e ITndienne \" ; or a few old roast partridges if it is to be termed \" Consomme au fumet de perdreau \" ; and so on. The means by which one may vary the aroma of con- sommes are legion, but it is highly important, what aroma soever be used, that the latter be not too pronounced. It ought only to lend a distinctive and, at the same time, subtle finish to the consomm6, which, besides sharpening the latter, should increase its succulence. When the consomme is served cold it ought to have the qualities of an extremely light and easily-melting jelly, barely firm; but when it is too liquid, it rarely gives that sensation of perfection and succulence to the palate of the consumer which the latter expects. When too firm and too gelatinous it is positively disagreeable; therefore, if it is to be relished, it should be just right in respect of consistency."

        "instructions": "Quantities for making Four Quarts. 4 lbs. of shin of beef (flesh and | lb. of minced carrots, browned bone). in butter. 4 lbs. of shin of veal (flesh and | lb. of minced onions, browned bone). in butter. i lb. of lean, raw ham. i faggot, containing a little pars- I lb. of fresh pork rind, rinsed ley, a stick of celery, a small in tepid water. sprig of thyme, and a bay leaf. Preparation. — Bone and string the meat, and keep it in readiness for the morrow. Break the bones as finely as pos- sible, and, after having besprinkled them with a little stock-fat, brown them in an oven ; also stir them repeatedly. When they are slightly browned, put them in a conveniently large sauce- pan with the carrots, the onions, and the faggot. Add five quarts of cold water, and put the saucepan on an open fire to boil. As soon as the boil is reached skim carefully; wipe the edge of the saucepan ; put the lid half on, and allow the stock to cook gently for twelve hours; then roughly remove the fat; pass the liquid through a sieve, and let it cool. This being done, put the meat in a saucepan just large enough to hold it. Brown it a little in some stock-fat, and clear it entirely of the latter. Add half a pint of the prepared stock, cover the saucepan, and let the meat simmer on the side of the fire until the stock is almost entirely reduced. Mean- while the meat should have been repeatedly turned, that it may be equally affected throughout. Now pour the remainder of the stock, prepared from bones, into the saucepan, bring the whole to the boil, and then move the saucepan to a corner of the fire for the boiling to continue very slowly and regularly with the lid off. As soon as the meat is well cooked the fat should be removed from the stock, and the latter should be strained or rubbed through a sieve, after which it should be put aside to be used when required. Remarks Relative to the Making of Brown Stock. — Instead of stringing the meat after having boned it, if time presses, it may be cut into large cubes before browning. In this case one hour and a half would suffice to cook it and to extract all its juice. Whether brown or white, stock should never be salted, because it is never served in its original state. It is either reduced in order to make glazes or sauces — in which case the concentration answers the purpose of seasoning — or else it is used to cook meat which miist be salted before being cooked, and which, therefore, imparts the necessary salt to its sur- rounding liquor. Brown stock ought to be the colour of fine burnt amber, and it must be transparent. It is used in making meat-glazes after reduction, also to moisten meat for braising and to prepare brown sauces."

The time allowed for cooking is, however, a little shorter, and this opera- tion may be completed within eight hours. This stock is mostly used as the liquor for poultry and poeled game, while it may also serve in the preparation of thickened veal stock.

Remarks upon White Stock. — One should contrive to make this stock as gelatinous as possible. It is therefore an indis- pensable measure that the bones be well broken up and cooked for at least eight hours. Veal never yields such clear stock as beef; nevertheless, the consomme obtained from veal should not be turbid. It must, on the contrary, be kept as clear and as white as possible.

I lb. of sliced, blanched onions. Preparation. — Butter the bottom of a thick, tall stewpan, put in the blanched onions and the parsley-stalks, and upon these aromatics lay the fish remains. Add the juice of a lemon, cover the stewpan, put it on the fire, and allow the fish to exude its essence, jerking the pan at intervals. Moisten, in the first place, with the white wine ; then, with the lid off, reduce the liquid to about half. Now add four quarts of cold water, bring to the boil, skim, and. then leave to cook for twenty minutes, only, on a moderate fire. The time allowed is ample for the purpose of extracting the aromatic and gelatinous properties contained in the bones, and a more protracted stew- ing would only impair the savour of the stock. Remarks upon White Fish Stock. — The formula which I give above diverges considerably from that commonly used, for, as a rule, fish stock is diluted far too much, and is stewed for much too long a time. I have observed that fish stock may be greatly improved by rapid cooking, and it was this considera- tion that led me to dilute it scantily, so as to avoid prolonged reduction. It is likewise necessary to remember that in order to make perfect fish stock, only the sole or whiting should be used. In a case of emergency, however, i.e., if the supply of the latter were to run short, a quarter of their weight of brill bones might be added to them. But all other kinds of fish should be avoided in the preparation."

        "instructions": "This stock is comparatively rarely used, because, in practice, it is naturally obtained in the cooking of the fish itself, as, for instance, in the case of the \" Matelotes.\" Be this as it may, with the recent incursion of a custom which seems to demand, ever more and more, the serving of fish without bones, the following formula will be worthy of interest, as it is likely that its need will henceforth be felt with increasing urgency. Fish fumet with red wine may be prepared from all fresh- water fish, as well as from the remains of sole, whiting, chicken- turbot, and brill. It is generally better, however, to have re- course to the bones and remains of that fish which happens to be constituting the dish — that is to say, the bones and trimmings of sole in a stock for fillet of sole, the bones and trimmings of a chicken-turbot in a fumet for a chicken-turbot, and so on. The preparatory formula remains the same, whatever the kind of fish used may be. Quantities for making Four Quarts of Fumet with Red Wine. — Four lbs. of bones, heads, and trimmings of the fish to be served; three-quarters lb. of minced white onions; three oz. of parsley stalks, two bay leaves, four small sprigs of thyme, and four cloves of garlic ; two bottles of red wine and five pints of water. Mode of Procedure. — Put all the above-mentioned in- gredients in a thick and tall stewpan, boil, skim carefully, and allow to cook twenty to thirty minutes on a moderate fire ; then strain the stock through a colander into a tureen, to be used when required. Remarks upon Fish Stock with Red Wine. — This stock stands reduction far better than white fish stock. Nevertheless, I urge the advisability of trying to obtain the required quantity without reduction. In its preparation, one may use some mush- room parings, as in the case of white stock, if these are handy, and they will be found to lend an agreeable flavour to the fish fumet."

It is infinitely simpler ta make savoury and succulent stock in the first place than to produce a mediocre stock, and finally complete it by a specially prepared essence. The result in the first instance is better, and there is economy of time and material. The most one can do is to recommend, in certain circum- stances, the use of essences extracted from particularly well- flavoured products, as, for instance, mushrooms, truffles, morels, and celery. But it would be well to remember that, nine times out of ten, it is preferable to add the product itself to the stock during the preparation of the same than to prepare essences.

Occasionally they serve in decking dishes with a brilliant and unctuous coating which makes them sightly; at other times they may help to strengthen the consistence of a sauce or other culinary preparation, while again they may be used as sauces proper after they have been correctly creamed or buttered. Glazes are distinguished from essences by the fact that the latter are only prepared with the object of extracting all the flavour of the product under treatment, whereas the former are, on the contrary, constituted by the whole base of the substance itself. They therefore have not only its savour, but also its succulence and mellowness, whereby they are superior to the essences, and cooking can but be improved by substituting them for the latter. Nevertheless, many chefs of the old school do not permit the use of glazes in culinary preparations, or, rather, they are of opinion that each cooking operation should produce them on its own account, and thus be sufficient unto itself. Certainly, the theory is correct when neither time nor cost is limited. But nowadays the establishments are scarce where these theories may be applied, and, indeed, if one does not make an abuse of glazes, and if they be prepared with care, their use gives excellent results, while they lend themselves admirably to the very complex demands of modern customs."

As it is only used to intensify the savour of sauces, it is sufficient for this purpose to prepare a white fish stock (Formula 11), which may be diluted with the stock already prepared, and which may be reduced according to the requirements. The name of fish fumet or fish essence is given to this preparation ; its flavour is more delicate than that of fish glaze, which it replaces with advantage. CHAPTER II THE LEADING WARM SAUCES Warm sauces are of two kinds : the leading sauces, also called \" mother sauces,\" and the small sauces, which are usually derived from the first-named, and are generally only modified forms thereof. Cooking stock only includes the leading sauces, but I shall refer to the small hot sauces and the cold sauces at the end of the auxiliary stock. Experience, which plays such an important part in culinary work, is nowhere so necessary as in the preparation of sauces, for not only must the latter flatter the palate, but they must also vary in savour, consistence and viscosity, in accordance with the dishes they accompany. By this means, in a well-ordered dinner, each dish differs from the preceding ones and from those that follow. Furthermore, sauces must, through the perfection of their preparation, obey the general laws of a rational hygiene, where- fore they should be served and combined in such wise as to allow of easy digestion by the frequently disordered stomachs of their consumers. Careme was quite justified in pluming himself upon the fact that during his stay at the English Court his master — the Prince Regent — had assured him that he (Careme) was the only one among those who had served his Highness whose cooking had been at all easy of digestion. Carlme had grasped the essential truth that the richer the cooking is, the more speedily do the stomach and palate tire of it. And, indeed, it is a great mistake to suppose that, in order to do good cooking, it is necessary to be prodigal in one's use of all things. In reality, practice dictates fixed and regular quantities, and from these one cannot diverge without upsetting the hygienic and sapid equilibrium on which the value of a sauce depends. The requisite quan- tities of each ingredient must, of course, be used, but neither more nor less, as there are objections to either extreme. Any sauce whatsoever should be smooth, light (without"
