(i) Have ready a saute-pan containing boiling salted water (one-third oz. of salt per quart of water), slightly acidulated with vinegar. Break the eggs over that part of the water which is actually boiling. (2) In order that the eggs may poach freely, do not put more than eight or ten at a time into the same saut(e-pan ; better even poach them six at a time, for then the poaching will be effected more equally. (3) As soon as the eggs are in the water, let the latter simmer. The egg is poached when the white has enveloped the yolk, reassuming, as it were, the form of a raw egg, and when it may be touched without breaking. The usual time allowed for poaching is three minutes. (4) Withdraw the eggs by means of a slice; dip them into cold water, trim their whites, and put them back into moderately warm water until ready to serve."

Keep the water boiling ; plunge the eggs therein as directed; leave them to cook for six minutes from the time the water has regained the boiling-point; drain, steep for a moment in a bowl of cold water, and shell the eggs care- fully.

Their shape is oval for poached eggs, and round for soft-boiled eggs, the latter being generally dished upright. (2) On little, oval feuilletes for poached eggs, on feuilletes in the shape of indented crowns, or in small patties for soft- boiled eggs. (3) In borders of forcemeat or other preparations, the kind of which is indicated by the name of the particular egg-prepara- tion. These borders are laid on the dish by means of a piping- bag or by hand; they are either oval or round, plain or in- dented, poached or oven-browned, according to the nature of the preparation used. (4) On tartlet-crusts which are garnished so as to be in keep- ing with the method of dressing the eggs. Remarks. — (i) Poached or soft-boiled eggs, when dished upon fried rusks, feuilletes, or tartlets, should, before being placed on the latter, be covered with sauce. Also before being treated with sauce they should be well drained. (2) Having given the general outlines of the procedure, I shall now pass on to the particular recipes, stating them briefly, and reminding the reader that all of them apply equally to poached and soft-boiled eggs.

        "title": "HARD-BOILED EGGS",
        "instructions": "Boiling eggs hard may seem an insignificant matter, but, like the other modes of procedure, it is, in reality, of some importance, and should be effected in a given period of time. If, for a special purpose, they have to be just done, it is point- less and even harmful to boil them beyond a certain time-limit, seeing that any excess in the boiling only makes them tough, and the whites particularly so, owing to their albuminous nature. In order to boil eggs uniformly, they should be put into a colander with large holes, whereby they may be plunged at the same moment of time into the boiling water. From the time the water regains the boiling point, eight minutes should be allowed in the case of medium-sized eggs, and ten minutes in the case of larger ones; but these times should never be exceeded. As soon as they are done drain the eggs and dip them in cold water, and then shell them carefully. Have ready beforehand a timbale crust (No. 2395), some- what shallow. For six hard-boiled eggs, slice four artichoke-bottoms of medium size, and stew them in butter; cut some truffles into slices, allowing four slices to each egg, and cut up the eggs into discs about one-half inch thick. Prepare also in advance one-half pint of Nantua sauce. Garnish the crust with alternate layers of sliced artichoke- bottoms, egg-discs, and sliced truffles. Finish with a coating of sauce and a ring of sliced truffles. Dish up the crust on a napkin. Cut the eggs, lengthwise, in two. Remove the yolks, pound them into a paste, and add thereto an equal quantity of dry Duxelle (No. '223). Fill the empty whites with the preparation; place them on a buttered eraiin-dish ; cover them with Mornay sauce; besprinkle with grated cheese; pour a few drops of melted butter upon the sauce, and set to glaze in a fierce oven. Cut the eggs into small dice (white and yolks). Per six eggs add five oz. of cooked mushrooms and one oz. of truffles, cut into dice. Thicken the whole with one-quarter pint of reduced Bechamel, and spread on a plate to cool. When cold, divide the preparation into portions weighing about two oz. ; roll these portions into balls on a floured mixing- board, and then shape them like eggs. Dip them into an anglaise (No. 174), taking care to cover them well with it, and then roll them in fine and fresh bread-crumbs, letting this operation avail for finishing off the shape. Put them into hot fat seven or eight minutes before dishing up ; drain, salt moderately, place on a napkin, with a centre garnish of very green, fried parsley, and send a cream sauce to the table with them. Make a preparation of eggs, as for the croquettes, using a little more sauce. Roll some puff-paste trimmings to a thick- ness of one-quarter inch, and stamp it with a round indented cutter two and one-half inches in diameter. Place a small tablespoonful of the preparation in the middle of each piece of paste; moisten slightly all round, and make the rissoles by folding the outside edges of the paste over one another to look like a closed purse, taking care to press them well together so as to join them, thus completely enclosing the preparation.

Whatever be the mode of preparation, the moulds should always be liberally buttered.

        "instructions": "This dish is undoubtedly the finest of all egg-preparations, provided the eggs be not over-cooked, and they be kept soft and creamy. Scrambled eggs are mostly served in silver timbales, but, in certain cases, they may also be dished in special little croustades, in little receptacles made from hollowed brioches, or in tartlet- crusts. Formerly, it was customary to garnish scrambled eggs served in a silver timbale with small, variously-shaped pieces of toast, or with small scraps of puff-paste, cooked without colouration, and shaped like crescents, lozenges, rings, palm- ettes, &c. This method has something to recommend it, and may always be adopted. In old cookery, scrambled eggs were sanctioned only when cooked in a bain-marie. This measure certainly ensured their being properly cooked, but it consider- ably lengthened the procedure. The latter may therefore be shortened by cooking the eggs in the usual way, i.e., in a utensil in direct contact with the fire; but in this case the heat must be moderate, in order that, the process of cooking being progressive and gradual, perfect homogeneity of the particles of the eggs (effecting the smoothness of the preparation) may result."

        "instructions": "For six eggs, slightly heat one oz. of butter in a thick- bottomed saut6-pan. Add the six eggs, beaten moderately, together with a large pinch of salt and a little pepper ; place the pan on a moderate fire, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon, taking care to avoid anything in the way of sudden, fierce heat, which, by instantaneously solidifying the egg- molecules, would cause lumps to form in the mass — a thing which, above all, should be guarded against. When, by cooking, the eggs have acquired the proper con- sistence, and are still smooth and creamy, take the saut6-pan off the fire, and finish the preparation by means of one and one-half oz. of butter (divided into small quantities) and three tablespoonfuls of cream. Only whisk the eggs to be scrambled when absolutely necessary. N.B. — Having given the mode of procedure, which is un- alterable for scrambled eggs, I shall now pass on, in the follow- ing recipes, to the various garnishes suited to this kind of dish. The quantities I give are those required for six scrambled eggs. Take one cottage brioche for every two eggs. Remove the tops of the brioches, and the crumb from the remaining portions, so as to form cases of these. Add one-half oz. of foie gras to the scrambled eggs, and half as much truffles, cut into dice, for every two eggs.

The mushrooms should first be minced raw, and then sauted in butter. Sprinkle a pinch of chopped parsley on the garnish, and surround with a thread of melted meat-glaze. Border the whole, close to the sides of the timbale, with small crescents of puff-paste, baked pale. Dish the scrambled eggs in a silver timbale. Place a little heap of shrimps' tails bound with a few tablespoonfuls of shrimp sauce in the middle, and surround with a thread of the same sauce. Add to the scrambled eggs a tablespoonful of parsley, chervil pluches, chives, and tarragon leaves in equal quantities and chopped. Break the eggs, beat them, season, and add thereto, for every two eggs, one-half oz. of fresh grated Gruyere cheese, and as much grated Parmesan. Cook the eggs in the usual way on a very moderate fire, in order to keep them creamy. Add to the scrambled eggs a tablespoonful of little crusts, cut into dice, fried in clarified butter, and prepared in time to be inserted into the eggs very hot. Dish in a timbale with a pinch of chopped parsley in the middle. Bake three fine Dutch potatoes, or six smaller ones, in the oven. Open them by means of an incision on their tops; with- draw the pulp from the interior with the handle of a spoon, and keep the remaining shells hot. Prepare the scrambled eggs in the usual way, and finish them away from the fire with one and one-half oz. of crayfish butter, and eight or ten shelled crayfish tails.

HORS=D'(EUVRE I only give one recipe of this kind, but the series may be extended at will without involving much deep research, since all that is needed for the purpose of variety is the modification of the garnish and a change in the souffle preparation. The mode of procedure remains unalterable. Prepare the scrambled eggs, and garnish them as fancy may suggest. Also make a \" Souffl6 with Parmesan Cheese \" (No. 2295a). Put the scrambled eggs into a large tartlet-crust, cook without colouration, filling them only two-thirds full. Cover with the souffle preparation, taking care to make it project in a mound above the tartlets ; place these on a tray, poach quickly in a hot oven, and glaze at the same time. Add to the scrambled eggs some minced morels, sauted in butter and seasoned. Dish in timbales, and place a fine, cooked morel in the centre of each. Proceed as for No. 471. Break the eggs, beat them, and add thereto a little fresh, thick cream. Cook them in the usual way, and add three cray- fishes' tails per every two eggs. Dish in little porcelain cases, place a fine slice of truffle in each of the cases, and arrange these upon a napkin lying on a dish."

Omelets The procedure for omelets is at once very simple and very difficult, for tastes differ considerably in respect of their pre- paration. Some like them well done, others insist upon their being just done, while there are yet others who only enjoy them when they are almost liquid. Nevertheless, the following conditions apply to all — namely, that there should be homogeneity of the egg-molecules; that the whole mass should be smooth and soft; and that it should be borne in mind that an omelet is in reality scrambled eggs enclosed in a coat composed of coagulated egg. I take as my standard an omelet consisting of three eggs, the seasoning of which comprises a small pinch of table-salt and a little pepper, and which requires one-half oz. of butter for its preparation. The quantities of garnishing ingredients given below, therefore, are based upon this standard."

N.B. — The nature of this preparation demands the use of oil in treating the tomato, but, failing oil, clarified butter may be used."

        "instructions": "Proceed as for other omelets, but one ordinary hen's egg is generally added to every six lapwings' eggs in order to give more body to the preparation. All the omelet recipes already given may be applied to lapwings' eggs. Garnish' as many small tartlet moulds as there are eggs with chicken-forcemeat. Poach, turn out the moulds, and hollow out the centres of the tartlets in such wise as to be able to set an egg upright in each. Place a soft- or hard-boiled egg on each forcemeat tartlet, coat the eggs with a light puree of mushrooms, besprinkle with chopped truffles, and arrange in a circle on a dish. Select as many large morels as there are eggs. Remove the stalks, and widen the openings of the morels ; season them, and stew them in butter. Boil the lapwings' eggs soft. Garnish each stewed morel with an egg; set them on little tartlet-crusts garnished with a light, foie-gras puree, and arrange them in a circle on a dish. Cold Eggs The preparation of cold eggs is not limited by classical rules; it rests with the skill and artistic imagination of the operator, and, since fancifulness and originality are always closely allied to artistic imagination, it follows that the varieties evolved may be infinite. Indeed, so various and numerous are the recipes dealing with this kind of egg-preparations that I must limit myself to a selection only of the more customary ones, culled as far as possible from my own repertory."

        "instructions": "Cook the eggs on the dish, leave them to cool, and trim them with an even fancy-cutter, oval in shape. Place each egg on an oval tartlet-crust, garnished with dice of cooked salmon, cohered with mayonnaise. Surround with a thread of caviare, and lay a thin slice of very black truffle on each egg. Garnish some small, oval moulds in Chartreuse fashion, i.e., like a draught-board. Put a small, cold, poached egg into each mould, fill up with melted, white jelly, and leave to set. Garnish the centre of a dish with a heaped vegetable salad ; arrange the eggs taken from their moulds around this, and surround with a little chopped jelly. Let a thin coat of white jelly set upon the bottom and sides of some small, oval moulds. Garnish the latter with some small dice, consisting of white of &gg and truffles, placing them so as to simulate a draught-board ; now insert a very small, cold, poached egg into each mould, and fill up with a melted jelly. Garnish the centre of a dish with a \" Rachel \" salad, en- circled by a ring of sliced, cold potatoes, cooked in water, and place the eggs, removed from their moulds, all round. Border the dish with indented crescents of white jelly. Mould these in baba-moulds, or in porcelain cocottes ; some times they may simply be dished up on small tartlet-crusts. The preparation consists of poached or soft-boiled eggs, garnished with blanched tarragon leaves, or coated or moulded with a very fine tarragon jelly. Select soine very small poached eggs of equal size, cover them with a white chaud-froid sauce combined with about a third of its volume of a puree of hard-boiled egg-yolks. Garnish the top of each egg with an indented ring of very black truffle, and surround the base of the eggs with a narrow ribbon composed of chopped truffles. Glaze with jelly, and leave to set on ice. Prepare a salad of green vegetables (peas, French beans cut into dice or lozenges, asparagus-tops) ; thicken it with a very little mayonnaise mixed with melted jelly. Pour this prepara- tion into an oiled mould, and leave it to set. For dishing, turn out the salad in the middle of a dish ; surround the base with a line of chopped jelly; encircle the whole with the eggs, letting them rest on the jelly, and garnish the dish with a border of dice cut in very clear, white jelly. Slightly level both ends of some shelled, hard-boiled eggs. Surround the tops and the bases with three little anchovy fillets, and place a bit of truffle just half-way along each egg. Eggs prepared in this way resemble little barrels, whereof the anchovy fillets imitate the iron hoops, and the bits of truffle the bungs. By means of a tubular cutter empty the eggs with care ; garnish them with caviare, and shape the latter to a point, outside the edges of the egg. Lay each egg in an artichoke-bottom, cooked white, and gar- nished with finely-chopped jelly, and arrange them in a circle on a dish with chopped jelly in the centre. Prepare some hard-boiled eggs to resemble little barrels, after the manner described above. For every six eggs keep ready and cold eighteen crayfish cooked k la Bordelaise. Shell the tails, put two aside for each egg, and cut the remainder into dice; finely pound the bodies and remains, add thereto three tablespoonfuls of thick cream, and rub through tammy. Add to this cullis one tablespoonful of thick mayonnaise. Bind the crayfish tails, cut into dice, with a few tablespoon- fuls of this sauce, and garnish the eggs, emptied by the method indicated above, with the preparation of dice, making it stand out of the eggs in the shape of a small dome. Garnish each dome with a rosette composed of four halved crayfish tails and four truffle lozenges. Glaze well with jelly; set the eggs upon artichoke-bottoms garnished with a mayonnaise with crayfish cullis, and arrange in a circle on a dish."

Thick soups, which comprise the Purees, Veloutes, and Creams. A third class, which is independent of either of the above, inasmuch as it forms part of plain, household cookery, em- braces vegetable soups and Garbures or gratincd soups. But in important dinners — by this I mean rich dinners — only the first two classes are recognised. When a menu contains two soups, one must be clear and the other thick. If only one is to be served, it may be either clear or thick, in which case the two kinds are represented alternately at different meals. In Part I. of this work I indicated the general mode of pro- cedure for consommes and thick soups; I explained how the latter might be converted from plain purees into veloutds or creams, or from veloutes into creams ; and all that now remains is to reveal the recipes proper to each of those soups. Remarks.— In the course of the recipes for consommes, given hereafter, the use of Royales (Nos. 206 to 213) and of Quenelles, variously prepared (Nos. 193 to 195), will often be enjoined. For the preparation of these garnishes, therefore, the reader will have to refer to the numbers indicated. The quantities for the clear soups that follow are all calcu- lated to be sufficient for a standard number of six people, and the quantity of Royales is always given in so many dariole- moulds, which contain about one-eighth pint, or baba-moidds, which hold about one-fifth pint. Of course, it will be understood that the poaching need not necessarily have been effected in these moulds, for very small \"Charlotte\" moulds would do quite as well. But I had re- course to the particular utensils mentioned above, in order that"
