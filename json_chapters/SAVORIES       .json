Canapes Garnished with Scrambled Eggs. — Set the scrambled eggs in domes upon the Canapes; sprinkle with grated Parmesan, and set to glaze quickly. Or arrange the scrambled eggs as above, and cover them with a lattice of anchovy fillets. Canapes de Haddock.— Cook the haddock ; rub it through a sieve; add a little butter and Bechamel sauce to the resulting puree, and set the latter in domes on the toast. For Variety. — Sprinkle the puree with grated Parmesan, and set to glaze. Or garnish the puree with oysters poached in a little Worcestershire sauce. Or again: cover the puree with a lattice of anchovy fillets. Canapes with Kippers or Bloaters. — Grill them and make a puree from them like the haddock, Canapes with Halved or Filleted Anchovies. — In the case of fillets, set them to form a grill upon the toast ; if the anchovies be halved, lay them lengthwise on the toast. Canapes with Sardines in Oil. — Clear the fish of their skins and bones, and set the fillets on the canapes. Canapes with Grilled Sprats. — Proceed as for sardines. Canapes of Salmon. — Toast may be garnished with thin slices of smoked or fresh salmon, or with the latter prepared in a puree like the haddock. Various Canapes. — Once the pieces of toast or canapes are grilled and buttered, they may be garnished with chopped smoked tongue or ham, cohered with a little butter and mustard, with grilled slices of mushrooms or tomatoes, &c. A few of the preparations have names, while others are only distinguished by the nature of their garnish."

The original method consists in melting the dice or slices of cheese in a few tablespoonfuls of pale ale and a little English mustard. As soon as the cheese has melted, it is poured over the pieces of buttered toast, quickly smoothed with the flat of a knife, and sprinkled with cayenne. The pieces may be cut up if required."

They generally consist of two slices of buttered bread, with mustard spread upon them, covering a slice of ham or tongue, &c. Sandwiches are usually rectangular, and they should measure about three inches by one and one-half inches. The kind served at ball buffets are much smaller, and therefore it is best to cut the sandwiched product (whatever this be) into dice, and to mix it with an equal weight of butter containing mustard. When sandwiches have to be kept, they should be placed under a slight weight to prevent the bread from drying. Sand- wiches may also be made from thick, toasted slices of bread, cut laterally into two, and then garnished according to fancy. Names of common Sandwiches. Ham Sandwich. Foie-Gras Sandwich.

Take an English tin-loaf, and cut off its two end crusts, leaving on them about one-third inch of crumb. Butter these crusts. Meanwhile grill a thick steak, well seasoned with salt and pepper. When it is cooked, cool it ; sprinkle it with grated horse-radish and mustard, and lay it between the two crusts. String the whole together as for a galantine, and wrap it in several sheets of blotting-paper. Then place the parcel under a letter-press, the screw of which should be gradually tightened, and leave the sandwich thus for one-half hour. At the end of this time the insides of the slices of bread have, owing to the pressure, become saturated with meat juice, which is prevented from escaping by the covering of crust. Remove the blotting-paper, and pack the sandwich in a box or in several sheets of white paper. CHAPTER XX Entremets (Sweets) Pastry, Confectionery, and Ices are so closely allied to Cookery, and they are so surely its complements, that it is impossible to omit them when dealing with Entremets, even though the latter be limited to the kind proper to the kitchen. However, these subjects, which could supply matter for voluminous works, are too complex for it to be possible to cope thoroughly with them here. I shall therefore confine myself to the expounding of their fundamental principles and the essential operations relating thereto, a knowledge of which is absolutely necessary for the successful preparation of Kitchen Entremets and Ices. The directions given hereafter are certainly too inadequate to con- vert an ordinary cook into a pastry-cook, a confectioner, or a \" glacier \"; but they will at least admit of his carrying out a complete dinner, if the necessity so to do should occur.

As soon as the skin slips when pressing them between one's fingers, turn them out on to a strainer ; cool them in cold water, and skin them. This done, wash them in cold water; drain them well; spread them on a very clean tray, and dry them in a mild oven. Splintered Almonds. — Having skinned and washed the almonds, split them in two, and cut each half into five or six splinters. Dry the latter in the drying-box, and place them in the front of the oven for a while to colour slightly."
