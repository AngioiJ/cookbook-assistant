Add two small ox-tails, or one of medium size weighing about four lbs. (The tails should be cut into sections, each of which should contain one of the caudal vertebras, and they should then be browned in the oven.) Also add two lbs. of gelatinous bones, broken very small and likewise browned in the oven. Now proceed exactly as for brown veal stock (No. 9), taking note that the whole moistening must consist of no more than two and one-half quarts of ordinary broth and one quart of water. Set to boil very gently for four and one-half or five hours. This done, strain the broth, which should be reduced to two and one-half quarts, and completely remove its grease. Transfer the largest sections of the tails, by means of a braiding-needle, one by one to another saucepan. Cover them with broth, and keep them warm for the garnish. Finely chop one lb. of very lean beef; put this mince into a saucepan with the white of a leek cut into dice and half the white of an egg, and mix thoroughly. Add the broth, the grease of which has been removed, set to boil, stirring con- stantly the while, and then leave to simmer for one hour, which is the time required for the beef to exude all its juices and for the clarification of the broth. While the clarification is in progress cut a small carrot in brunoise fashion, or turn it by means of a very small spoon. Cook this garnish in.a little water with butter, salt, and sugar. A few minutes before serving strain the ox-tail broth through a napkin, put the sections of ox-tail and brunoise into the soup-tureen, and pour thereon the prepared broth. This soup may be flavoured with port or sherry, but this is optional. N.B. — If a thickened ox-tail soup be required add to the broth per every quart of it one-third of an oz. of arrowroot diluted with a little of the broth or some cold water."

        "title": "TURTLE SOUP",
        "instructions": "With the exception of a few leading London restaurants, where a large quantity of this preparation is constantly in demand, turtle soup is very rarely prepared in the kitchens of catering establishments. It is more generally obtained ready- made, either fresh or preserved, and as a rule of exceptional quality, from firms whose speciality it is to make it, and who deliver it in excellent condition. From among the London firms who have deservedly earned. a reputation for this soup, \" P6criaux \" may be quoted as one whose produce is quite irreproachable. When a comparatively small quantity of this soup is re- quired, it is best to buy it ready-made; in the event of its being desirable to prepare it oneself, the following recipe will be found the simplest and most practical for the purpose. Particulars of the Operation The Slaughtering of the Turtle. — For soup, take a turtle weighing from 120 to 180 lbs., and let it be very fleshy and full of life. To slaughter it, lay it on its back on a table, with its head hanging over the side. By means of a double butcher's hook, one spike of which is thrust into the turtle's lower jaw, -while the other suspends an adequately heavy weight, make the animal hold its head back ; then, with all possible dispatch, sever the head from the body. Now immediately hang the body over a receptacle, that the blood may be collected, and leave it thus for one and one-half or two hours. Then follows the dismemberment : — To begin with, thrust a strong knife between the carapace or upper shell and the plastron or lower shell, exactly where the two meet, and separate the one from the other. The turtle being on its back, cut all the adhering flesh from the plastron, and put the latter aside. Now cut off the flippers; remove the intestines, which throw away, and carefully collect all the green fat. Whereupon cut away the flesh adhering to the carapace; once more remove all fat, and keep both in reserve. The Treatment of the Carapace, the Plastron, and the Flippers. — The carapace and plastron, which are the outside bony framework of the turtle, constitute the only portions where- from the gelatinous flesh, used as the garnish of the soup, are obtained. Saw the carapace into six or eight pieces, and the plastron into four. Put these pieces with the flippers into boiling water or into steam, to blanch. Withdraw the flippers as soon as they are sufficiently stiff for their skin to be removed, and leave the pieces of carapace and plastron to blanch for five minutes, in order that they may admit of being scraped. Now cool the pieces of carapace and plastron and the flippers, and put them into a stewpan containing enough water to abundantly cover them. Set to boil; garnish with vegetables, as in the case of an ordinary broth, and add a small quantity of turtle herbs. Five or six hours should be allowed for the cooking of the carapace and the plastron, but the flippers, which are put to further uses in other culinary preparations, should be withdrawn at the end of five hours. When the pieces are taken from the cooking-liquor, remove all the flesh from the bones, and cool the former; then trim it carefully, and cut it into little squares of one and one-half inches side. It is these squares together with the green fat (poached in salted water and sliced) which constitute the garnish of the soup. The Preparation of Turtle Soup. — There are two modes of procedure, though their respective results are almost identical. 1. Make a broth of the flesh of turtle alone, and then add a very gelatinous beef consomme to it, in pursuance of the method employed when the turtle soup is bought ready-made. This procedure is practically the best, more particularly if the soup has to be kept some time. 2. Make an ordinary broth of shin of beef, using the same quantity of the latter as of turtle. Also include half a calf's foot and one-half lb. of calf's shin per 3 lbs. of the beef. Add the flesh of the turtle, or, in the event of its being thought necessary to clarify, which operation I do not in the least advise, reserve it for that purpose. The condiments and aromatics being the same for both methods, I shall now describe the procedure for method No. i. The Ingredients of the Soup. — Put into a stewpan of con- venient size the flesh of the turtle and its head and bones. Moisten partly with the cooking-liquor of the carapace, and complete the moistening, in the case of a turtle weighing 120 lbs., with enough water to bring the whole to 50 quarts. By this means a soup of about thirty to thirty-five quarts will be obtained at the end of the operation. Add salt in the proportion of one oz. per every five quarts; set to boil; skim, and garnish with twelve carrots, a bunch of leeks (about ten bound with a head of celery), one lb. of parsley stalks, eight onions with ten cloves stuck into them, two lbs. of shallots, and one head of garlic. Set to boil gently for eight hours. An hour before straining the soup, add to the garnish four strips of lemon-peel, a bunch of herbs for turtle, comprising sweet basil, sweet marjoram, sage, rosemary, savory, and thyme, and a bag containing four oz. of coriander and two oz. of pepper- corns. Finally, strain the soup through a napkin; add the pieces of flesh from the carapace and plastron which were put aside for the garnish, and keep it until wanted in specially-made sandstone jars. The Serving of the Soup. — When about to serve this soup, heat it; test and rectify its seasoning, and finish it off by means of a port wine glass of very old Madeira to every quart. Very often a milk punch is served wkh turtle soup, the recipe being : — Milk Punch. — Prepare a syrup from one-half pint of water and three and one-half oz. of sugar, the consistence at the boil being 17° (Baume's Hydrometer). Set to infuse in this syrup two orange and two lemon zests. Strain at the end of ten minutes, and add one-half pint of rum, one-fifth pint of kirsch, two-thirds pint of milk, and the juice of three oranges and three lemons. Mix thoroughly. Let it stand for three hours; filter, and serve cold. 6 15- CONSOMME TOSCA Have ready one quart of chicken consomm6 thickened with three tablespoon fu Is of poached tapioca strained through linen. Also prepare two tablespoonfuls of a julienne of carrots stewed in butter, the cooking of which is completed in the con- somme ; ten small quenelles of chicken forcemeat, combined, in the proportion of one-third, with foie gras and chopped truffles ; ten small, very crisp profiterolles, stuffed with a puree of chicken with pistachio kernels. Put the quenelles and the julienne into the soup-tureen, pour therein the boiling consomme, and send the profiterolles to the table separately, and very hot."

Special Cold Consomm6 for Suppers Remarks Relative to the Consommes. — I gave the recipes of these consommes in Part I. of this work (No. 6), and shall now, therefore, limit myself to the following remarks, which are of paramount importance : — 1. These consommes must be perfect in limpidness and quality. 2. The flavour which typifies them should be at once decided and yet not too pronounced. 3. When the flavour is imparted by a wine, the latter should be of the best possible quality. Rather than make use of in- ferior wines, the presence of which in the soup would tend to depreciate its quality, completely discard wine flavourings. 4. Supper consommes never contain any garnish."

When too thick, these soups are pasty and disagreeable; when too thin, they are insipid ; hence the desirability of aiming at a happy medium. Their garnish is exceedingly variable, the more preferable forms being small bread dice fried in clarified butter, pressed; peeled tomatoes cut into dice and tossed in butter; small prin- taniers, brunoises, juliennes, faysannes, or well-poached rice.

Remarks concerning the Possible Variation of this Soup, — The mode of procedure adopted in the case of the Germiny could, if necessary, be appUed to all thick soups, and it would then constitute a class to which the term \" Cream \" would be better suited than it is at present to the soups thus designated. Instead of the ordinary white consomme, which is used in its preparation, a consomm6 may be used in which such vege- tables as carrots, turnips, peas, &c., are cooked, the latter being reserved for the garnish, while the cooking-liquor is thickened with egg-yolks and cream in accordance with the quantities and directions given in the above recipe. A carrot cream, a cream of fresh peas, or of asparagus-heads, prepared in this way, would be much more delicate than those prepared after the ordinary recipes. The essential point in this series of soups is the leason ; this should consist of enough egg-yolks to render the preparations sufficiently thick and creamy."

Stone two-thirds lb. of small, fleshy cherries, and put twenty aside for garnishing purposes. Put the others into a sugar- boiler with two-thirds pint of hot water, a small strip of lemon rind, and a fragment of cinnamon, and set to boil quickly for eight minutes. Also boil in another sugar-boiler one-half pint of Port or Bordeaux wine. Crush half of the cherry-stones in the mortar; put them into the boiled wine, and let them infuse, away from the fire. Rub the cooked cherries through a fine sieve; dilute the pur6e with the juice thickened by means of one tablespoonful of fecula moistened with cold water; add the cherries put aside for the garnish, and one-half tablespoonful of castor sugar, and again set to boil for four minutes. Complete the preparation with the infusion strained through muslin ; pour it into the soup-tureen, and add a few biscottes. For the sake of variety, lady's-finger biscuits may be sub- stituted for the biscottes."

        "instructions": "Set half a fowl to cook very gently in one and one-half pints of light and clear veal stock with a few aromatics. Also prepare a julienne of the white of three leeks; stew this in butter without colouration, and complete the cooking thereof in the cooking-liquor of the fowl, strained and poured carefully away. Pour the preparation into the soup-tureen, and add the meat of the fowl, cut into a julienne. Serve some stewed prunes separately, but this is optional. Make a roux from one and one-half oz. of butter and as much flour. When it has acquired a nice, light-brown colour, moisten it with one quart of white consomme or brown stock, and set to boil, stirring the while. Add one-half lb. of raw chickens' livers rubbed through e sieve, and set to cook for fifteen minutes. Rub the whole through tammy ; season strongly with pepper ; heat, and com- plete the preparation, at the last moment, with one-quarter lb. of sliced chickens' livers, tossed in butter, and one wineglass of good Madeira. Cook quickly in salted water two small, peeled, and quartered potatoes. Drain them, rub them through a fine sieve, and dilute the puree with one and one-half pints of white consomme. Add three tablespoonfuls of a julienne made in accordance with the above recipe; heat, and finish the preparation with an ordinary leason and one and one-half oz. of butter."

        "instructions": "Brown the minced white of two small leeks and one-third of an onion, also minced, in one oz. of chopped, fresh breast of bacon, and one-half oz. of grated, fat bacon. Moisten with one and one-half pints of white consomme, and add one-third of a carrot, one-third of a turnip, half a stick of celery, two oz. of small cabbage, and one small potato, or one-half of a medium-sized one, all of which vegetables must be finely minced. About twenty-five minutes after the soup has started cook- ing, complete it with two tablespoonfuls of peas, a few French beans cut into lozenges, and one and one-half oz. of rice, or the same quantity of very thin macaroni broken into very small pieces. This done, set to cook again for thirty minutes. A few minutes tJefore serving, add to the soup one small, crushed clove of garlic, three leaves of sweet basil, and a small pinch of chopped chervil pluches ; mix the whole with one-half table- spoonful of grated bacon. Send to the table, separately, at the same time as the soup some freshly grated Gruyere."

        "title": "MULLIGATAWNY SOUP",
        "instructions": "Cut a small fowl, or half a medium-sized one, into little pieces, and put these in a stewpan with a few roundels of carrot and onion, a small bunch of parsley and celery, one-half oz. of mushroom parings and one quart of white consomme. Set to boil, and then let cook gently. Also lightly brown in butter half a medium-sized onion, chopped; besprinkle it with one dessertspoonful of fecula and one coffeespoonful of curry ; moisten with the cooking-liquor of the fowl, strained through a sieve; boil, and set to cook gently for seven or eight minutes. Now rub the whole through tammy, and leave it to despumate for twenty minutes, adding one tablespoonful of consomme, from time to time, with the view of promoting the despumation, i.e., the purification of the soup. When about to serve, finish the preparation with three or four tablespoonfuls of cream. Pour the whole into the soup- tureen ; add a portion of the meat of the fowl, cut into thin slices, and serve separately two oz. of rice k I'lndienne. This soup is held in high esteem by Americans. It is served either with garnish, as I direct below, or as a consomme, hot or cold, or in cups, after it has been strained. Fry one medium-sized chopped onion in two oz. of butter, without letting it acquire any colour. Add one-quarter lb. of fresh lean bacon, or raw ham cut into medium-sized dice; fry for a few minutes, and add about one lb. of boned chicken- meat cut into large dice (the white parts of the chicken are used in preference) ; let these ingredients stiffen well ; take care to stir fairly often, and moisten with two quarts of white chicken consomme. Boil, and set to cook gently for twenty or twenty- five minutes with lid on. Now add about one-half lb. of peeled gombo, cut in coarse paysanne-fashion, and three or four medium-sized tomatoes, peeled, concussed, and with their seeds withdrawn. When the gombos are well cooked, carefully remove all grease from the preparation; test the seasoning, and, if neces- sary, add a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Garnish the soup with two or three tablespoonfuls of plainly- cooked rice. N.B. — This soup is excellent if it be finished with one-quarter pint of cream per quart. A cream of gombos may also be pre- pared, which may be garnished with the dice of chicken meat. In the latter case, the garnish of rice is optional. Finely mince one small carrot, one small turnip, one leek, one-third of a stick of celery, one-third of an onion, and some cabbage leaves. Stew the vegetables in one oz. of butter; moisten with one and one-half pints of white consomme, and set to boil. A few minutes having elapsed, add two small potatoes minced like the other vegetables, and complete the cooking gently. Send separately some roundels of soup-flutes. otherwise A LA BONNE FEMME Finely mince the white of four medium-sized leeks. Put this into a stewpan with one oz. of butter, and stew gently for a quarter of an hour. Then add three medium-sized quartered potatoes, cut into roundels the thickness of pennies. Moisten with one pint of white consomm6; add the necessary quantity of salt, and set to cook gently. When about to serve, finish the soup with one pint of boiled milk and one and one- half oz. of butter; pour it into the soup-tureen, and add twelve roundels of French soup-flutes, cut as thinly as possible. Proceed exactly as for ' ' Soupe aux Foies de Volaille, ' ' but substitute for the garnish of sliced livers one of calf's or sheep's kidney cut into large dice, or sliced, and briskly tossed in butter just before dishing up. Finish the soup similarly to the preceding one, i.e., with Madeira. S 2 CHAPTER XIV FISH In matters culinary, fish comprise not only the vertebrates of the sea and river, but also the esculent Crustacea, mollusca, and chelonia, and one batrachian. Of course, the animals representing these various classes differ enormously in respect of their importance as articles of diet. Fresh-water fish, for in- stance, with the exception of salmon and some kinds of trout, are scarcely ever eaten in England; and the same applies to the frog. As regards salt-water fish, although certain species, such as the sole and the turbot, are in great demand, many other and excellent ones which are looked upon as inferior are seldom put into requisition by first-class cookery. Thus, Brill, Fed Mull&t, and Bass are not nearly so popular as they de- serve to be, and never appear on a menu of any importance. No doubt. Fashion — ever illogical and wayward — exercises her tyrannical sway here, as in other matters of opinion ; for it will be found, even when the distinctions among fish are once established, that there exist a host of incongruities in the un- written law. Fresh cod is a case in point; should this fish appear on the menu of a grand dinner given by Royalty, the guests would not think it at all out of place; but if the chef of a large modern hotel ventured to include it among the items of a plain table-d'hote dinner he would most probably incur the scorn and indignation of his clientele. This example, than which none could be better suited to our case, successfully shows that the culinary value of the fish has far less to do with the vogue the latter enjoys than the very often freakish whims of the public. One can but deplore the arbitrary proscription which so materially reduces the resources at the disposal of a cook, more particularly at a time when the universally imperious cry is for novelty and variety in dishes and menus respectively; and one can only hope that reason and good sense may, at no remote period, intervene to check the purposeless demands of both entertainers and their guests in this respect."
